41294-10ladisl.jpg	Of the Hungarian kings St Ladislas is perhaps the one most often represented in post-medieval frescoes, altar paintings and statues. In the Middle Ages he was associated with the ideal of chivalry and the legends which gathered around him determined the manner of his representation. Thus the knightly armour and the battle-axe have become permanent attributes, in addition to the crown and the orb.The painting illustrated here, dating from the late sixteenth century, is only superficially linked with medieval portraits of St. Ladislas. The king is shown seated on a throne wearing an ample, richly embroidered cloak studded with pearls round the hem. In the foreground is a voluted and foiled shield with the national emblem, stylized in harmony with the throne. The background is designed to suggest the interior of a Renaissance palace. Through opening on either side of the wall behind the throne - draped with embroidered hangings - there is a view of landscape. A similar motif was often used to fill in the background in north Italian Madonna paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The monochrome landscape on the left is a topographic reference to one of St. Ladislas' most important church activities, the foundation of the Cathedral in Nagyvárad, while the one on the right shows his legendary defeat of the Cumanian abductor. This evocation of two popular episodes from the story of the king's life is intended partly to identify St. Ladislas as a rule of worldly power, and partly to indicate the ideal unity of the Christian king and the Christian knight.St Ladislas is shown as a historical personage, without a halo - a fact indicating that the painting was destined for a secular building. The episodes from the king's life or, to be mere accurate, from legends associated with his name, are treated as historical facts. The same approach characterized the series of prints of royalty and other notabilities which became so popular all Europe in the course of the sixteenth century. It may be assumed that such prints served as models for the painted portrait of St. Ladislas and the two related pictures of St. Stephen and St Emeric	UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian	Saint Ladislaus, King of Hungary	Oil on wood, 103 x 101,3 cm	c. 1600	religious	Hungarian	1551-1600
42791-1sacris.jpg	This ceiling painting in the sacristy of San Sebastiano has an unusual iconography compared with older depictions. Mary is being crowned by Christ, while God the Father touches His Son's shoulder with his left hand. The date of completion of the ceiling painting is recorded in a book in one of the four corner tondos held by a winged angel. The inscription reads: M.D.L.V./ DIE XXIII/ NOVEMBER (November 23, 1555)	VERONESE, Paolo	Coronation of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 200 x 170 cm	1555	religious	Italian	1551-1600
14376-worship.jpg	In the same period when the most talented artists in the country had gathered around Rubens in Antwerp, there were also other artists working in Antwerp who still clung to the taste of Rubens' predecessors. One of these was Frans II Francken, who painted Rockox's 'constcamer'. He was a very popular artist in his time, and although he lacked any outstanding imaginative power or great technical skill, his fame rests on his ability to convert monumental subjects from large-scale art works to proportions more suitable for private houses. The Worship of the Golden Calf is a typical example of the many religious and mythological scenes he painted	FRANCKEN, Frans II	Worship of the Golden Calf	Oil on panel, 60 x 88 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
24776-annuncia.jpg	"Based on its style the Annunciation is attributed to the Master of Flémalle and dated between c. 1415 and 1425. The painter's provisional name refers to the ""Abbey of Flémalle"" where certain of his works are assumed to have been painted. However, in this village near Liège there was never any abbey. Today the master is commonly identified with the Tournai artist Robert Campin.The scene takes place inside a bourgeois dwelling, a novelty in the painting of the time, as until then the scene had always been depicted in or in front of a church. In line with tradition, Gabriel enters the room from the left. The Virgin is seated in front of a low bench on the tiled floor, a sign of her humility. The edge of her mantle is decorated with an inscription, another innovation of the Master of Flémalle. Its text appears to be inspired by the popular medieval Marian hymn Salve Regina. The Virgin's gestures illustrate her acceptance. Her right hand rests on her breast, her eyes modestly cast downwards. On Mary's lap is an open book, a second one lies on the table. This motif is possibly taken from devotional tracts of around 1400, which state that the Virgin was meditating on the Holy Scriptures when Gabriel entered. The books also indicate her as the possessor of divine wisdom. In this connection, the bench is decorated with little lions, as was once the throne of Solomon, the Old Testament king who used to be seen as the epitome of wisdom. The stained glass figures possibly represent prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.Other apparently everyday objects also have an additional, deeper significance. The hand broom next to the chimney symbolises the purification from the stain of sin, and the white lilies in the maiolica vase Mary's virginity. The open window probably alludes to her honorary title as 'fenestra coeli', the window of heaven. The candles and their holders refer to Christ and the Virgin. The fact that the candles are snuffed out indicates that conception has already taken place. One intriguing detail is the woodcut above the chimney, depicting St Christopher carrying the Child across the river. This motif is a good illustration of the chronological jumps frequently found in the paintings of Flemish Primitives, as according to the main scene, depicting the Annunciation, the Saviour has not even been born"	MASTER of Flémalle	Annunciation	Tempera on oak, 61 x 63,7 cm	1420s	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

07338-st-john.jpg	This painting, contracted on 23 November 1635, was executed for the convent church of Santa Paula in Seville. It is evident that the artist had mastered an Italianate manner of painting; the figure of the angel alone is sufficient to corroborate this observation. The partly clad body, the complicated, foreshortened pose, and the mastery of anatomical drawing are unique elements in Sevillian painting of the time, as are the deep perspective of the landscape and the delicate, translucent colours.Cano's mastery of this facile, sophisticated style suggests that he had passed time in Italy, although there is not the slightest evidence that he left the city until his final departure in 1638	CANO, Alonso	Saint John the Evangelist's Vision of Jerusalem	Oil on canvas, 83 x 44 cm	1636-37	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

24464-pisa_pr1.jpg	This painting is the central predella panel of the Pisa Altarpiece, directly beneath the enthroned Madonna and Child. Compared to Gentile da Fabriano's painting of the same subject done in Florence just a few years before, Masaccio's treatment is entirely new. Besides offering lifelike portraits of the patron and his nephew in contemporary dress at the middle right, he has given the entire scene a convincing atmosphere which surrounds the figures and the landscape. In the distance, the atmosphere breaks down the clarity of the forms resulting in an effect which is referred to as aerial perspective	MASACCIO	Adoration of the Magi	Tempera on poplar, 21 x 61 cm	1426	religious	Italian	1401-1450

16988-nuenen03.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 30, JH 479.In Nuenen between January and August 1884, van Gogh depicted the figure of the weaver working at the loom in several pen drawings, watercolours and oil paintings. In this small village of Northern-Brabant, to where his parents moved in September 1882, more than four hundred people took up weaving, an activity of domestic industry during the winter months, when agricultural labour was suspended.The chronology of the series could be determined by the development in representing the loom. As time went by, van Gogh depicted the loom with more and more precision, abandoning the anecdotal elements and concentrating on the work process and on the machine itself	GOGH, Vincent van	Weaver, Seen from the Front	Oil on canvas, 70 x 85 cm	May 1884, Nuenen	other	Dutch	1851-1900

23235-predell1.jpg	Lorenzo Veneziano fulfilled countless commissions in Venice and its vicinity that display a handsome fusion of Byzantine and later pictorial currents. His commissions included that for an altarpiece which was later dismembered. The central panel depicting Christ Giving the Keys to St Peter is now in the Museo Correr, Venice, the side panels were destroyed in Berlin in 1945. The five predella panels survived, they comprise the Conversion of Paul; the Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew; the Christ Rescuing Peter from Drowning; the Apostle Peter Preaching; the Crucifixion of Peter	LORENZO VENEZIANO	Conversion of Paul	Poplar panel, 26 x 33 cm	c. 1370	religious	Italian	1351-1400
10416-19melanc.jpg	Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560) was a German reformer, collaborator with Martin Luther, the first systematic theologian of the Protestant Reformation, intellectual leader of the Lutheran Reformation, and an influential designer of educational systems. He stands next to Luther and Calvin as a reformer, theologian, and molder of Protestantism.Melanchthon had his portrait painted on numerous occasions, but he only sat to four artists: Albrecht Dürer (in an engraving of 1526); Hans Holbein the Younger (whose portrait of circa 1535 is in the Nieders&#228;chsisches Landesmuseums, Hannover); and both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son Lucas Cranach the Younger.Cranach the Younger painted several portraits of Melanchthon, probably from the mid 1540s onwards. The earliest would seem to be that dated 1544, in Östra Ryd, Sweden, and the last painted from life is that signed and dated 1559 in the St&#228;del Museum, Frankfurt am Main, finished just one year before Melanchthon's death at the age of 63. Such was the demand for portraits of Luther and Melanchthon that several posthumous works were produced by Cranach the Younger and his studio	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Portrait of Philipp Melanchthon	Oil on pine panel, 63 x 49 cm	c. 1550	portrait	German	1501-1550

18525-2summer1.jpg	Abel Grimmer continued the themes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and evoked the four seasons in many of his paintings. He copied the subjects produced by Bruegel while adding his own mark: a stylisation of the forms and the introduction of powerful colours.The present panel of Summer is an interpretation of the famous drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This drawing inspired numerous artists including his son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger. Not all refer to the drawing itself, but rather to the engraving of it made by Pieter Cock around 1570. Engraving flourished in Antwerp in the 16th century and was an excellent means of distribution. Hence, artists were familiar with the works of their contemporaries.There are other versions of this painting by Abel Grimmer	GRIMMER, Abel	Summer	Oil on panel, 24 x 37 cm	-	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
34296-sabine2.jpg	The Rape of the Sabine Women and its companion-piece the Battle of the Romans and the Sabines illustrates the legend of Rome's foundation.Romulus, the founder of Rome, succeeded by a ruse in ensuring the future growth of the population. He arranged a festival to which were invited the inhabitants of neighbouring settlements including the Sabines, with their wives and children. During the festivities, at a given signal, the young men of Rome broke into the crowd and, choosing only unmarried maidens of the Sabines, carried them off. The Sabine women accepted their lot. But later a Sabine army attacked the city in force and succeeded in overcoming part of it. They were prevented from going further by the intervention of the Sabine women which brought about peace between the warring soldiers.The glowing colours of the two paintings reveal the influence of Paolo Veronese, while the pastel illumination of Ricci's palette anticipates the Rococo	RICCI, Sebastiano	Battle of the Romans and the Sabines	Oil on canvas, 197 x 303 cm	c. 1700	historical	Italian	1701-1750
18753-guard219.jpg	"Francesco Guardi was a collaborator of Gianantonio, from whom he learned the craft of painting, but he introduced into his older brothers art his own profoundly meditative personality. This fact is evinced by the essential differences to be discerned in the works the ""workshop"" produced. This picture, unanimously attributed by researchers to Francesco, is, in all likelihood, the fragment of a larger composition. The whole scene is summarized in the slow and calm movement of the gondoliere in the foreground, whereas the scenery of the lagoon virtually disintegrates in the mother-of-pearl atmosphere, which is lightened here and there by some rare flashes in the background. The lonely gondola is seen in the lagoon at the Fondamente Nuove, in front of the islands of San Cristoforo and San Michele.The emotional intensity of the painting is condensed into this brief recording of the moment, as if it were a ""phrase in music"", for example in Vivaldi's or Albinoni's compositions of the same theme. The smooth lagoon and the ""adagio continuo"" are parallel motifs of picture and music. The scenery becomes dissolved in musicality, as musicality disintegrates ""in sorrowful weeping"" (Goethe).The mournful character of the black gondola is both a forecast and a conscious experience of the future destiny of the world of lagoons &#151; a world enclosed within its own modest boundaries. This is a world which has disappeared, because it was linked to a declining civilization. The argument was not continued, and it has not been taken up again; the other lagoon painters, such as the members of the Burano school, could not disguise the emptiness &#151; not only of form but also of content."

28665-1london3.jpg	"This canvas belongs to a series of eleven paintings executed after Monet's stays in London. The Parliament building is viewed from a window of St. Thomas's Hospital located on the opposite shore of the Thames.During his four visits to London between 1900 and 1905, Monet did a series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament. In these works his art attained new heights. Everything visible is resolved in the reflection of light. The subtitle of the painting, ""With the Sun Shining through Fog"", is significant. Not only the sky, but also the river and even the buildings are fused together in dazzling colour tones. The Houses of Parliament rise up out of the fog like a vision. It is not the building which seems to be present but rather its optical effect"	MONET, Claude	The Houses of Parliament in London	Oil on canvas, 81 x 92 cm	1904	landscape	French	1851-1900
25321-triptyc1.jpg	This painting is the central panel of a triptych. The wings represents Sts John the Baptist and Anthony of Padua with the donor Bonifazio Lupi (left), and Sts John the Evangelist and Louis of Toulouse with Catarina dei Francesi, the donor's wife.While continuing to refer to Giotto, Florentine painters began to introduce a refined linear Gothic style.

23919-denial.jpg	Manfredi created a series of theatrically lit compositions in which bawdy figures crowd around a table gambling, drinking and making music. In his Denial of St Peter the tavern scene is transformed into a religious narrative in which the soldiers' game of dice is given more prominence than Peter's betrayal.

21214-richter2.jpg	The mood of the time is very evident in the matching pair of portrait's of Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal, who was a Viennese official who had been ennobled, and his wife, Maria Angelica Richter von Binnenthal, née Freiin von Zach. The graceful wife bears the 25-year difference in age from her husband with the same dignity as he wears his 1814 medal. Moreover, the colours of the clothing are skillfully balanced: her black dress with its white collar is the inversion of his Habsburg uniform. Her white lace collar also indicates a fashion during the Restoration, when the house of Habsburg liked to look back to its old Spanish empire	KRAFFT, Johann Peter	Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal	Oil on canvas, 53 x 43 cn	1814-15	portrait	Austrian	1801-1850

21435-fetewood.jpg	The composition reflects Lancret's dependence on Watteau, under whom he had briefly studied c. 1717.

20040-032mocki.jpg	This painting is closely related to another work by Honthors, a vertical version of the same theme in a private collection. Since some of the same expressive devices are found in both pictures - for example , the way in which the extended hand of the standing mocker holding a candle casts its shadow on his face - both were likely to have been executed relatively close in time.The size of the canvas suggests that it was a public commisssion, perhaps for a church in or near Rome	HONTHORST, Gerrit van	The Mocking of Christ	Oil on canvas, 146 x 207 cm cm	c. 1617	religious	Dutch	1601-1650
41521-z_battle.jpg	This large tapestry cartoon represents a subject drawn from Livy and Polybius. It was preparatory for the weaving of a section of the Tapestry of Scipio executed in Brussels c. 1558 for Jacques d'Albon, Maréchal de Saint-André and favourite of King Henri II  of France. The artist, who was certainly Mantuan and shows himself here to be a follower of Giulio Romano, was perhaps Fermo Ghisoni (c. 1505-1575)	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	The Battle of the Ticino	Distemper on sheets of paper mounted on canvas, 385 x 655 cm	1550s	historical	Italian	1551-1600
39675-13tribut.jpg	The subject of this painting is taken from the New Testament. The Pharisees ask Christ whether it is right to pay tax to the Romans. Christ, sensing the trap, asks whose likeness and name are on the coinage: 'They say unto him, Caesar's. Then he saith unto them, render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's' (Matthew 22; Mark 12, Luke 20).This painting was probably painted for King Philip II and sent to Spain in 1568	TIZIANO Vecellio	Tribute Money	Oil on canvas, 112 x 103 cm	1560-68	religious	Italian	1501-1550

Like his father he sought a military career; he entered the army in 1726 and was a captain in the 3rd foot guards by the end of 1734.

19406-stillif1.jpg	Heda did not start to paint diagonal compositions until the mid-1630s: the compositions start with flat plates, continue with pieces of ham and goblets, and culminate in a zenith-like fashion with beer or water jug. At times this pattern was of course broken, especially when Heda had to depict the valuable crockery of distinguished households, such as columbine goblets, cups of welcome, etc. Heda then went back either to his triangular or his pyramid-shaped compositions. But it is noticeable that whenever he did this, he also increased the incidence of 'chaotic' elements, showing, for example, the white table-cloth extremely crumpled as well as an overturned jug. (The overturning of goblets goes back to an ancient custom, and in the 16th and 17th centuries goldsmiths, for example, fashioned special goblets that had to be emptied all at once so that they could be placed on the table upside down.

16070-joachi1.jpg	The elderly Joachim is denied entry to the temple, as he has remained childless. The architecture reinforces the priest's gesture of rejection, to which the saint replies with a saddened look. The sheep, as a sacrificial animal that has become superfluous, has a particularly touching effect.The rejection of Joachim's sacrifice and his expulsion from the Temple occurred because of his childlessness. Here we are dealing with a true opening picture: the closed architecture of the temple introduces the first idea of solidity, while Joachim's dual movement brings this scene to a close, on the one hand, and on the other paves the way for the rest of the series, which finds a premature conclusion in the last picture of this register, the Meeting at the Golden Gate.The action is also driven forward by the repetition of buildings. Thus the temple of the opening picture reappears in the fresco Presentation of Christ at the Temple	GIOTTO di Bondone	No. 1 Scenes from the Life of Joachim: 1.

39719-2venus_a.jpg	"Between 1553 and 1554 Titian executed for the Habsburgs two classical mythological works of clearly erotic intent which he himself described as ""poesie"" (mythological fables). These are the Dana&#235; with a Nurse and the Venus and Adonis, both now in the Prado, Madrid. The Venus and Adonis became the prototype for a whole series of replicas of this subject.Venus, the goddess of love, falls in love with Adonis, a beautiful youth. Her love is not, however, enough to stop him pursuing his favourite pastime, hunting, which will lead to his undoing, for he is gored to death by a boar. There is an interesting letter from Titian to Philip II which deals with this painting. The artist makes a special point of mentioning that he was particularly interested in depicting the body from both sides.In both paintings the scene of the union of the lovers is bathed in the warm light of sunset, where the diffuse softness of the colours holds sway. The female nudes reveal the continuing inspiration of Michelangelo's sculpture, such as the Dawn and Night from the Medici tombs in Florence. But what is entirely personal to Titian is the quality of the colour, which fragments into patches of dazzling luminosity - a perfect complement to the ecstatic sensuous abandon of the figures.In its own day Venus and Adonis was considered one of Titian's most erotic works, especially in the compression of Venus' buttocks in her seated pose, but it also suggests the indulgent condescension of a younger man towards the frantic and overprotective reaction of an older woman"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 180 x 207 cm	1554	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

26746-06_1sp5f.jpg	The figures are in the triangular spandrel in the sixth bay between Ezekiel and the Persian Sibyl. The spandrel is situated over the Rehoboam-Abijah lunette.Michelangelo painted a family group in this lunette. The woman, seen in profile, is seated in the foreground, in an absorbed attitude, her chin resting on her hand; with her other arm she embraces her child. Behind her, the gray-haired head of a male figure emerges from the shadows.Above, on each side of the ram's skull, the bronze nudes no longer take the form of motionless, reclining figures, but are howling demons who struggle furiously in almost acrobatic positions in the restricted space enclosing them. Although their poses are perfectly symmetrical, their hair seems to be blown in the same direction, as if by a sudden gust of wind.It is usually assumed that the male figure in the shadows represents Solomon, the father of Rehoboam	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Ancestors of Christ: figures	Fresco, 245 x 340 cm	1511	religious	Italian	1501-1550

Herodias uses the tip of her knife to make her mark in the saint's forehead; she is presented as the perfect courtesan untrustworthy and vindictive. Herod himself, with his thick lips, hooked nose and narrowed eyes, even seems a little frightened by what he has just done.

18912-11aurora.jpg	The ceiling painting in the Sala della Fama, the central hall on the second floor, is entirely allegorical. The central picture is designed as a fictive opening with only a few figures. In the centre hovers the personification of Fame in billowing robes, holding in her outstretched hands an extremely long trumpet and an olive branch as a symbol of peace. Flying in front of her is the brightly feathered phoenix of myth, which is reborn out of its own ashes every five hundred years and was therefore considered a symbol of eternal renewal, but was understood also as a link to virtue. In the lower part of the picture space personifications of Honour (Honos) and Virtue (Virtus) are seated on a dark gray cloud.

00819-marco_p9.jpg	This picture was placed on the right lateral side of the predella. Justinian sleeps while Sts Cosmas and Damian enter his chamber trailing patches of soft cloud. They replace his corrupted leg with a healthy one. The room is Spartan but the variety of light-sources and Angelico's close observation give it interest. Light floods in from outside through the window on the left, illuminating its own frame and parts of the swags of curtain. Exterior space is indicated not only by the window but by the door opposite it, from whence comes more light. From the front left outside the picture comes the third source of light, which produces a broad diagonal sweep across the right wall. The curtain provides the rectangular backdrop parallel to the picture surface which is common to each of these predella panels, and also hints at more, obscured space behind it. The container hanging from a nail on the side of the bed, the glass and decanter, the slippers and the simple three-legged stool, all provide the constituents of a closely observed still-life	ANGELICO, Fra	The Healing of Justinian by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian	Tempera on wood, 37 x 45 cm	1438-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450
34462-18rippl.jpg	The picture represents a major milestone in Rippl's oevre where two periods meet: elements of  intimate interior pictures  and those of the next decorative period with  corn are present. There is a constant figure of interior pictures: a old man smoking the pipe while he is meditating. He is present in this picture, too, he is sitting by the artist's father lost in thoughts. Unlike his previous pictures showing interiors, he limits space and does not show details, only relevant things. It integrates less formal pictures arresting emotions and atmospheres with pictures of strict composition.In the case of this picture everything is planned, colours and figures serve the unity of the composition. Spots and patches painted with wide brushstrokes can be seen in the figure of Uncle Piacsek and the lively yellow of the plain background. Neither the new technique, nor  the noisy colours  (yellow wall, burning-red table-cloth)  serve unrestrained decorativity, they balance the strict composition.  This is why an armchair  with blue striped cover  and a green cover are placed  on both sides by the yellow background. The wine-jug and the two glasses have the same function in composition	RIPPL-RÓNAI, József	Father and Uncle Piacsek Drinking Red Wine	Oil on cardboard, 68 x 100 cm	1907	portrait	Hungarian	1851-1900
30682-basket.jpg	This painting of a basket of flowers and its pair (Madrid, Museo del Prado) follow closely a type of flower piece made popular by Juan de Arellano in which the flowers occupy an open weave wicker basket placed on a rough stone ledge. Such images of flowers casually arranged and filling an open weave basket differ from the formal presentations of bouquets in vases and were perhaps intended to be seen as recently-gathered fresh flowers on short stems. Although the paintings have been considered early works by Pérez for reasons of their closeness to the typology of Arellano s works, they show that the painter was evidently in full possession of the technical resources that distinguish his mature style.In the 17th century, flower paintings commonly made up the decoration of chapels and monastic institutions. While it does not appear that symbolism played a significant role in Spanish flower paintings, viewers of a more sombre cast of mind could have read a Vanitas message in such pictures, in which the brief life of the flowers was a metaphor for human existence.

41468-madfinch.jpg	According to legend, the goldfinch acquired the red spot on its brow when it removed a thorn from Christ's head during his ascent to Calvary, and was splashed with a drop of blood. Its inclusion in images of the Madonna and Child is, therefore, a symbol of Christ's future Passion.This well-preserved panel was formerly attributed to Antonio Vivarini, then to Girolamo di Giovanni da Camerino. However, it appears to be by an anonymous Tuscan artist close to Domenico Veneziano and Giovanni di Francesco	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Madonna and Child with a Goldfinch	Tempera on panel, 77 x 51 cm	around 1450	religious	Italian	1401-1450

11177-1870s_77.jpg	Louis Edmond Duranty (1833-1880) was a prolific French novelist and art critic. He supported the realist cause and later the Impressionists. He was a frequent visitor to the Café Guerbois group, which included Manet, at the centre of the group, and many writers and painters. Their vigorous debates provided Degas with an entirely new mental environment.Degas was particularly close to Duranty, and painted a celebrated portrait of him in 1879.

On the right of the picture, the royal household and dignitaries of empire are gathered, while the father of the bride, Count Raynald of Burgundy, kneels on the steps to the left of the altar, accompanied by two pageboys. The court jester, seen from behind, occupies a prominent position in the foreground at the foot of the steps to the altar, an example of Tiepolo's penchant for introducing witty and frivolous ideas to the agreed pictorial subject matter. The steps to the altar lead us into the picture and, along with the colossal background architecture, create great spatial depth. The musicians on the balcony in the background are a favourite motif of Tiepolo, which he uses to help make the historical subject matter topical	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Marriage of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Beatrice of Burgundy	Fresco, 400 x 500 cm	1751	historical	Italian	1701-1750

00475-venus2.jpg	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn. These subjects represent two of the most recognizable and classic of all mythological stories, both with a rich history of pictorial representation in Venetian art. They are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses, and in the case of Venus and Adonis, Amigoni returned to the subject throughout his career	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Bacchus and Ariadne	Oil on canvas, 104 x 129 cm	1730s	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

05715-03beach.jpg	"The skill at seizing the ephemeral and noting essentials characterize the views of Trouville painted by Boudin. Trouville was a fashionable resort under the Second Empire.Boudin, the son of a Honfleur sailor, spent most of his life in seaside towns and concentrated on painting landscapes by the sea, everyday coastal scenes. The tradition he was following was primarily an English one, though Boudin did not paint ships at sea. The pictures he painted over the years in his loose, sketchy way did not, strictly speaking, possess any central subjects. Even his market or beach scenes present an extensive panorama of colour and economically deployed line accentuation. The atmosphere is bright, moist and highly sensitively registered.

When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ismael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved.

Part of his time was dedicated to painting for the Buen Retiro theater, where his undeniable talent for scenographic painting developed. This is displayed in his Virgin and Child with Sts Philip and Francis which might be called the first High Baroque altarpiece painting in Spain. The composition is enclosed within an illusionistic proscenium arch, behind which is seen a landscape vista drawn in the deep perspective of contemporary stage sets. The Virgin and Child are surrounded by a small army of fluttering putti, whose varied poses imitate the heavenly glories of Rubens.

20185-commemor.jpg	Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory.

12490-05self26.jpg	This self portrait is dated 1498 and inscribed: `I have thus painted myself. I was 26 years old. Albrecht Dürer.' Since the artist turned 27 on the 21 May, the picture must date from the beginning of the year. The artist's pose is self confident, showing him standing upright and turning slightly to lean his right arm on a ledge. Dürer's figure fills the picture, with his hat almost touching the top. His face and neck glow from the light streaming into the room and his long curly hair is painstakingly depicted. Unlike his earlier self portrait, he now has a proper beard, which was then unusual among young men. Nine years later Dürer wrote an ironic poem in which he described himself as `the painter with the hairy beard'.The artist's clothing is flamboyant. His elegant jacket is edged with black and beneath this he wears a white, pleated shirt, embroidered along the neckline. His jaunty hat is striped, to match the jacket. Over his left shoulder hangs a light-brown cloak, tied around his neck with a twisted cord. He wears fine kid gloves.Inside the room is a tall archway, partly framing Dürer's head, and to the right a window opens out onto an exquisite landscape. Green fields give way to a tree-ringed lake and beyond are snow-capped mountains, probably a reminder of Dürer's journey over the Alps three years earlier. Depicting a distant landscape, viewed through a window, was a device borrowed from Netherlandish portraiture.The Germans still tended to consider the artist as a craftsman, as had been the conventional view during the Middle Ages. This was bitterly unacceptable to Dürer, whose second Self-Portrait (out of three) shows him as slender and aristocratic, a haughty and foppish youth, ringletted and impassive. His stylish and expensive costume indicates, like the dramatic mountain view through the window (implying wider horizons), that he considers himself no mere limited provincial. What Dürer insists on above all else is his dignity, and this was a quality that he allowed to others too.This picture was acquired by Charles I of England and later bought by Philip IV of Spain	DÜRER, Albrecht	Self-Portrait at 26	Oil on panel, 52 x 41 cm	1498	portrait	German	1501-1550

02996-nativity.jpg	Baldovinetti's Annunciation is in the atrium of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. His interest in local landscape is evident in the Arno Valley view that he chose as the background of this fresco. In fact he painted only a few portions of the picture in true fresco, and then waited until the plaster had dried so that he could paint 'a secco.' But because the fresco was located in an atrium exposed to winter fogs and even rain, in time the a secco faces, hands, and drapery peeled off, and his underdrawing is now visible. Even so, the painting is impressive in the airy openness of its setting and the view over the expansive Tuscan plain, which is filled with the light of a clear winter day	BALDOVINETTI, Alessio	Nativity	Fresco, 400 x 430 cm	1460-62	religious	Italian	1451-1500
31304-childhoo.jpg	This scene, which probably formed part of a group of panels devoted to the life of Christ, brings together in one spatial setting various episodes from Christ's childhood, giving the painting great narrative interest. Along with the Nativity (treated in the traditional manner of the period, with the Virgin lying down and Joseph on a lower level), the artist has also included the shepherds in the background, two women washing the new-born Christ, and the Adoration of the Magi.

42013-attribut.jpg	The old rivalry between painting and sculpture, the sister arts devoted to the imitation of nature, resurfaces in this painting. The painters had shown that, in their two-dimensional pictures, they were quite capable of offering several views of a body that was equally beautiful from all sides. What theoreticians had presented as an advantage of sculpture became a particular challenge to painting. A plaster Academy model of the antique Belvedere Torso (1st century AD, Rome, Vatican) is here rendered in paint. Like painting and sculpture, architecture was also considered an art of draughtsmanship. Inspired by Chardin, this academic still-life is devoid of all reference to the theme of vanitas that was generally present in compositions on a comparable theme by the older Dutch masters: the focus now falls upon the enlightened erudition of art	VALLAYER-COSTER, Anne	Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture	Oil on canvas, 90 x 121 cm	1769	still-life	French	1751-1800
38597-guardrox.jpg	In a large, open, barn-like structure, which serves as a guardroom, groups of monkeys wearing soldiers' uniforms are grouped around tables playing cards and back-gammon.Pictures of monkeys had been popular from the sixteenth-century and it was Teniers who developed the theme in the seventeenth-century. The primary role of the monkey in visual and literary sources of the sixteenth-century was to represent the irrational and foolish side of man's nature, but monkeys also were symbols of sinfulness and seen as devils	TENIERS, David the Younger	Guardroom with Monkeys	Oil on panel, 41 x 58 cm	1633	genre	Flemish	1651-1700

37294-40madonn.jpg	"A great deal has been written about the iconography of the Madonna from Lucignano d'Arbia, very unusual in Sienese painting. Mary is shown looking to the right, instead of to the left, and she holds a Child who is not yet a ""puer"" (as was the case in all the earlier paintings) but still an ""infans"" in swaddling clothes. The reason that led Simone to choose this iconography has yet to be explained, and it may have been a specific request from the client; but scholars do agree on the attribution of the panel to Simone"	SIMONE MARTINI	Madonna and Child (from Lucignano d'Arbia)	Tempera on wood, 88 x 51 cm	1321	religious	Italian	1301-1350

28672-3bridge1.jpg	In 1893, Monet purchased land with a pond near his property in Giverny, and he built here his water lily garden with a Japanese bridge spanning the pond at its narrowest point. In 1899, he began a series of eighteen views of the wooden footbridge over the pond, completing twelve paintings, including the present one, that summer. The vertical format of the picture, unusual in this series, gives prominence to the water lilies and their reflections on the pond	MONET, Claude	Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies	Oil on canvas, 93 x 74 cm	1899	landscape	French	1851-1900

18403-1903grec.jpg	El Greco painted several views of Toledo. Seen beneath mountainous clouds the city stirred his imagination and in this painting, as in others, the representation includes an element of fantasy and is not strictly accurate. In the El Greco Museum there is a painting in which a young man is seen holding up a map of the city. The map partially corrects the view of the city in which, to improve the composition as the inscription tells us, El Greco gave the Hospital of Don Juan Tavera a central place in the picture; transferring it from its actual setting so that the façade could be shown without blocking out the other important buildings. In the upper part of the picture there is a scene in which the Virgin presents a vestment to St Ildefonso. The landscape is painted in brownish-green and blue tints, and the mythological and religious elements are minimal; with his pictures of Toledo El Greco created the Spanish landscape, a branch of art which was nevertheless neglected until the emergence of Velázquez.It is sometimes supposed that the young man is a portrait of El Greco's son, who was, however, at least thirty years old at that time	GRECO, El	View and Plan of Toledo	Oil on canvas, 132 x 228 cm	c. 1610	landscape	Spanish	1551-1600
09642-grotesq1.jpg	This painting (and another in the same private collection) are illuminating examples of the type of decorative flower pieces in series in which De la Corte specialised. The complete series is likely to have comprised a number of other pictures of the same type. These pictures are trompe l'oeil works that depict fictive carved stone or stucco-work grotesques of scrolling vegetable ornament with intertwining flower garlands. It is unlikely that these grotesques existed as such and they were most probably copied from 16th or 17th-century ornamental prints.While the grotesques are repeated in each picture, the floral arrangements vary and offer a delightful interplay between the natural-looking flowers and the stylised vegetable ornaments. The repetition of the grotesque decorations and the downward-looking angle of the cherubs gaze in the paintings suggest that these pictures were intended to make up a frieze on the upper part of the wall in a private residence of the time.

03935-stbernar.jpg	Jacopo Bellini had more than one opportunity to observe St Bernardino (1380-1444) and hear him preach. His portrait gives us a close-up view of the saint who stands before a velvet cloth decorated with thistle leaves and Christ's monogram. The saint's mouth is open, displaying three small teeth, and his eyes are directed downward toward a crucifix. The saint is shown as a living, speaking presence, perhaps the first such portrait of the Renaissance.The Sienese preacher St Bernardino, a prominent figure in the reform branch of the Franciscan order known as the Observants, was widely portrayed. In addition to a death mask, there are medals, standing and bust-length painted depictions, terracotta busts and statues, and engravings. Following his canonization in 1450, he was shown repeatedly in altarpieces	BELLINI, Jacopo	St Bernardino da Siena	Tempera on wood, 30 x 21 cm	1450-55	religious	Italian	1401-1450
07486-16martha.jpg	The painting has an iconographically very unusual theme. It shows Martha reproaching Mary Magdalene for her vanity, a subject that we know through a series of copies. The painting at Detroit has recently been recognized as the original.The religious theme is treated in a substantially profane manner. It is a pretext for making passages of highly intensive painting and for constructing an image that, seen in the context of the usual dichotomy of Caravaggio's early years, is more of a genre scene than a religious one	CARAVAGGIO	Martha and Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 98 x 133 cm	c. 1598	religious	Italian	1551-1600
42149-conquest.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.The iconographic theme of the hall of the Sala dello Scrutinio was inspired by the Venetian naval victories on the Eastern seas shown in the numerous ceiling canvases depicting virtues and symbolic figures. Vassilacchi's Conquest of Tyre on the wall of the Sala del Scrutinio depicts a historical event which occurred in 1123 under the rule of Doge Domenico Michiel, who commanded the Venetian fleet in the East	VASSILACCHI, Antonio	Conquest of Tyre	Oil on canvas	c. 1590	historical	Italian	1551-1600
41878-vendra01.jpg	This villa is typical of the Veneto Region with gardens and decorative murals. It was owned by the Grimani family for more than 200 years and bequeathed to the comune by its last private owner, Elena Vendramin Calergi (married Andrea Valmarana in 1826). It is now the seat of The Valmarana foundation named for her.The villa underwent extensive renovations in 1757 on the occasion of the marriage of Francesco Vendramin Grimani Calergi and Bianca Morosini. This was the time when Andrea Urbani was engaged to fresco the portego (the large ground-floor room that traverses the building from front to back) and the seven rooms on the second floor.The decoration of the portego is limited to the walls, on which there are three large landscapes set within ornate, faux architectural settings, also designed by Urbani. The west wall contains View of a Villa with a Pool and Landscape with Waterfall, while the opposite wall has View of a Large Renaissance Palace, divided into two parts by the staircase door. In the centre foreground of each landscape, on a trompe-l'oeil pedestal, is a faux-bronze statuary group representing the struggle between Good and Evil	URBANI, Andrea	View of the portego	Fresco	1764-68	interior	Italian	1751-1800
06288-backoper.jpg	The figures in Brouwer's later pictures, produced after he had settled in Antwerp, are especially animated in gesture and expression, manifesting an unprecedented display of skill matched only by the sophisticated style in which they were painted. The Back Operation is an outstanding representative of Brouwer's late style. The artist has intensified the monochromatic effects of his earlier works, rendering them in a higher key than previously, and he has reduced his composition to just three figures who proportionally occupy a significant area of the interior space	BROUWER, Adriaen	The Back Operation	Oil on panel, 34 x 27 cm	1635-36	genre	Flemish	1601-1650

19482-1portrai.jpg	The companion-piece of this painting, the portrait of Pieter Bicker Gerritsz. is also in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.The traditional identification of the couple is probably incorrect, the two portraits represent a young and hard-working couple, they were painted probably to mark their betrothal	HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van	Portrait of Anna Codde	Oil on panel, 86 x 66 cm	1529	portrait	Dutch	1501-1550

15337-jupiter.jpg	The composition of this painting is clearly related to a work by Luca Giordano depicting the Sleeping Venus with Cupid and a Satyr in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. Given the great popularity of Giordano's work in Florence, it is conceivable that Gherardini knew the composition of Venus with Cupid and a Satyr through other versions or drawings, and presented it in his own idiom	GHERARDINI, Alessandro	Jupiter and Antiope	Oil on canvas, 150 x 193	-	mythological	Italian	1651-1700

06087-taylor_s.jpg	Quiringh van Brekelenkam worked in Leiden, where he was influenced by Dou's domestic subjects and by Metsu's broad touch and intense colours. He is best known for his paintings of men and women artisans working at various crafts: cobblers, lace makers, spinners, fish mongers, and so forth. Outstanding is his Tailor's Shop of 1653 at the Worcester Art Museum where he finds quiet poetry in a view of a humble interior with the master and his two apprentices at work, seated tailor-fashion on the table while an old woman prepares a meal. Thirteen variations of the Worcester painting have been recorded (fine ones are at Amsterdam, London, Philadelphia, and Bonn); an indication that there must have been a good market for the motif. Like so many genre painters of his time, he turned to more elegant subjects in the sixties	BREKELENKAM, Quiringh van	Interior of a Tailor's Shop	Oil on canvas, 55 x 75 cm	1653	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

13281-l_dacre.jpg	Eworth was a portraitist originated from Antwerpen. He worked from 1549 in England. His predecessor in the royal court was Hans Holbein the Younger who strongly influenced his style.

28339-pitti1.jpg	The architectonical elements of quadratura, or trompe-l'oeil, decoration provide the grand duke's Private Audience Hall with startling illusionistic effects. On its rear wall Mitelli painted a grand double staircase that visually enlarges the actual size of the room through a deceptive perspectival device. The figure of a court official, painted by Mitelli's partner Angelo Michele Colonna (c. 1600-1687) is seen in the act of climbing the imaginary stairs, thus adding a sense of illusionary reality.In the Palazzo Pitti commission the Colonna-Mitelli collaboration developed a successful model that the pair was able to translate to other situations. The best example of this is the painting, from a few years later, in the salone of the d'Este summer residence in Sassuolo, near Modena	MITELLI, Agostino	View of the Sala dell'Udienza del Granduca	Fresco	1636-41	interior	Italian	1601-1650

05055-landscap.jpg	During his lifetime Bonzi was particularly renowned for his still-lifes, but, like Filippo Napoletano, he was also active as a painter of landscapes. His output in this genre became entangled with that of Agostino Tassi, even though the two do not really have much in common. In addition to this canvas, Bonzi's certain works include The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and The Rest of Hercules (both in the Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome), Nymph and Faun (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini, Rome) and Latona and the Frogs (Musée du Louvre, Paris).Bonzi was clearly influenced by Annibale Carracci and to an even greater extent by Domenichino, but his compositions are more open on both sides and his terrain much flatter. His foregrounds spread out freely without obstacles such as large rocks or bushes, almost inviting the viewer to walk into the picture. His rather awkward figures tend to move parallel to the picture plane in a frieze-like procession. In the early 1620s he worked at the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal hill with Filippo Napoletano, each decorating different rooms. In this landscape Bonzi's close attention to naturalistic detail suggests the influence of Bril. Establishing a chronology for Bonzi's landscapes is almost impossible, but this work is perhaps not too far in date from the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi frescoes. The shepherds' nakedness indicates that the scene is not contemporary (even though sheep-farming had largely replaced cultivation in the Roman campagna around this time), but rather an episode from Virgil's Arcadia	BONZI, Pietro Paolo	Landscape with Shepherds and Sheep	Oil on canvas, 47 x 64 cm	c. 1621	landscape	Italian	1601-1650

28386-bearded.jpg	The sitter is most probably the artist's father, Giovan Battista Mola who himself was an architect.

39994-3redhea4.jpg	There are very different types of woman in Lautrec's female gallery, with whom he had more or less lasting relationships. They tend to remain anonymous, known only by their first name, or by their portraits, which are rich in psychological, humorous human perceptions. Most of them are red-heads, for Lautrec had a passion for red hair.

34916-1auxerr1.jpg	In St. Stephen's Chapel in the crypt of Saint-Germain in Auxerre, the visitor is confronted by a surprising composition: the stoning of St. Stephen is depicted in a tympanum. It illustrates, inspired by the text from the Acts of the Apostles (6:12), the final phase of the appearance of St. Stephen before his judges. In the middle of the trial he has a vision and declares that God has appeared to him. Then accused of blasphemy, he is stoned to death.Nearly all of the left-hand half of the picture is taken up by the representation  of a town which is scaled down in size in proportion to the figures. St. Stephen has just been dragged through this city gate and onto the place of his execution. Towering behind the humble St. Stephen, his torturers are depicted with their arms raised up ready to throw the stones. The figure of St. Stephen himself projects into the right half of the picture which otherwise consists of an empty space, broken up to great effect by the appearance of the hand of God	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French	Stoning of St Stephen	Fresco	c. 800	religious	French	0751-0800

00468-sisera.jpg	This painting relates the story of Jael and Sisera in tones of delicate colours that contrast emphatically with the drama of the biblical event recounted. It was painted after the artist's return too Venice from travels that took him to most of Europe, when his palette became brighter and more refined.Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera	AMIGONI, Jacopo	Jael and Sisera	Oil on canvas	c. 1739	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
19439-stil_lif.jpg	"De Heem's still-life paintings initially followed the style of the Haarlem school, but later drew closer to the more lavish Flemish style of large-scale still-lifes. Nevertheless, certain Dutch elements cannot be overlooked. In this painting, they are particularly evident at the points where a ""dialectical principle"" determines the compositional structure.A mass of fruit and flowers ranging from ripe chestnuts to blackberries, from columbine to roses, has been arranged on a stone slab. A wide variety of surfaces, each with a different effect in light, with pure or iridescent colours, is spread out before us. Yet snails are already crawling across the vine leaves, the foliage is discoloured and withering and, the ears of grain are curling, the peach has burst its skin, the citrus fruit is half peeled, the white carnation is dried and drooping over the table edge.At the very point where the image bears an iconographic message of the transience of worldly life in the form of nature's riches, we see these things in their last bloom of beauty. Just as a ruin could represent the picturesque appeal of architecture, so too can a vine leaf riddled with snails seem picturesque in the full and final flowering of its beauty"	HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de	Still-Life	Oil on panel, 56 x 74 cm	-	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650

32214-19midas.jpg	In Greek legend Midas was a king of Phrygia who was granted a wish by Bacchus in return for a good deed he had done to Silenus, a follower of the god. Midas wished that everything he touched be turned to gold, but soon realized his mistake when all food became inedible. Bacchus ordered him to wash in the River Pactolus in Lydia. Hence the popular aetiology of the gold-bearing properties of the river, thought to have been the source of wealth of the kings of Lydia, of whom Croesus was the last.Midas is depicted penitently before Bacchus, a drunken Silenus sleeping nearby.

30863-keys.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Likely in charge of the entire project of the fresco decoration on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, Pietro Perugino retained for himself not only representations on the altar wall (which eventually were replaced by Michelangelo's Last Judgment) but also other significant scenes, such as Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, a most fitting subject for Pope Sixtus' chapel. The fresco is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the gold and silver keys to the kneeling St Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open piazza is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles, although they are not used in defining the spatial organization. Nor is the relationship between the figures and the felicitous invention of the porticoed Temple of Salomon that dominates the picture effectively resolved. The triumphal arches at the extremities appear as superfluous antiquarian references, suitable for a Roman audience. Scattered in the middle distance are two secondary scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right.The style of the figures is dependent upon Verrocchio. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to  minor detail.The octagonal temple with its ample porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael	PERUGINO, Pietro	Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter	Fresco, 335 x 550 cm	1481-82	religious	Italian	1451-1500
10630-riverban.jpg	Cuyp's earliest dated landscapes of 1639 are astonishingly eclectic, but by 1641 he was painting panoramic views of the Dutch countryside in the monochromatic mode of van Goyen. The young Cuyp, however, favoured a distinct yellow tonality as against van Goyen greyish and brown hues. More important for Cuyp's subsequent development was the impact of Dutch landscapists who brought an Italianate style from Rome back to Holland; Cuyp himself never travelled to the south.Since very few of Cuyp's landscapes are dated, and none is dated after 1645, it is difficult to say precisely when the characteristic golden light, reminiscent of the Campagna the artist never saw, replaces the earlier paler one, and when mountain ranges, herds of cattle, and figures conspicuously set off against a sky begin to play an important role in his compositions. But by 1645 distinct traces of the style of Cornelis Poelenburgh, a member of the first generation of Italianate painters, and Jan Both, the leading artist of the following generation of Italianate landscapists, are evident. Jan Both became Cuyp's principal source of inspiration. The River-bank with Cows shows how rapidly he assimilated Both's motifs and sun-drenched light. From this time onward golden sunlight becomes the all-pervading element in Cuyp's paintings. It spreads warmth and beauty over the Dutch countryside, where sturdy animals - most often cows - take place of human heroes	CUYP, Aelbert	River-bank with Cows	Oil on canvas	c. 1650	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
37371-moret1.jpg	Sisley went tirelessly in search of motifs along the Seine and its tributaries, he looked no further. He abided by views of village streets, or of interesting groups of buildings, he would be drawn to an old stone bridge, the kind of subject that had fascinated painters since Corot. In unprepossessing patches of gardens or meadows, landscapes on the skirts of towns or along river banks, he could often discover the most arresting colour or light effects	SISLEY, Alfred	Moret-sur-Loing in Morning Sun	Oil on canvas, 61 x 74 cm	1888	landscape	French	1851-1900

29886-isaac.jpg	The painter stayed in Italy at the height of Caravaggio's popularity, and the influence of Caravaggio can be seen in this painting.

32451-sebastia.jpg	This canvas is the creative legacy of Mattia Preti's stay in Naples. The picture clearly takes off Caravaggio's light as its point of departure. The refined way in which it is painted, however, as well as the use of elegant details and the classically-inspired pose of the saint's statuesque body bathed in a ray of light are all extremely revealing about the painter's extensive and important travels. In fact, Preti amalgamated the most disparate influences with great originality	PRETI, Mattia	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas, 240 x 169 cm	c. 1656	religious	Italian	1651-1700
14981-1paris02.jpg	The Moon and the Earth is Gauguin's depiction of an ancient Polynesian myth, in which Hina, the female spirit of the Moon, implores Fatou, the male spirit of the Earth, to grant humans eternal life. It is a request Fatou resolutely denies. The painting was included in the exhibition that Gauguin organized at Durand-Ruel's gallery in Paris in November 1893. The works exhibited were his most recent: a few sculptures, three paintings from Brittany and 41 from Tahiti. In the end, only 11 paintings were sold and the artist Degas bought Hina te Fatou	GAUGUIN, Paul	Hina te Fatou (The Moon and the Earth)	Oil on canvas, 112 x 61 cm	1893	mythological	French	1851-1900

In fact, biting one's hand is a traditional symbol of envy, one of Cain's seven sins. In the medallion of the grotesque decor below, a murder scene with Triton-like creatures is depicted. Here the murder weapon is the jawbone of an ass, the one used by Cain in killing his brother Abel.This fresco fragment was discovered during a recent restoration	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Fresco fragment	Fresco	1499-1502	other	Italian	1451-1500
18886-abraham.jpg	Guercino is one of the most interesting personalities in seventeenth-century Bolognese art, and his activity in Rome made him an important influence on all Italian painting. More than from Venice and Correggio, his work derives from Dosso Dossi and the school of Ferrara. This painting represents one of the high points of Guercino's mature style. Its restoration by the Brera's laboratory has revealed the original colours and eliminated the yellowish patina that obfuscated and partially hid the composition.The painting is built up on a measured circular rhythm, and the prominent gestures of the figures are emphasized almost to the point of theatricality. Little Ishmael is crying and leaning his head against Hagar. As she consoles him and holds out a handkerchief, she turns toward Abraham, who stands stern and still, making a gesture of repudiation. Sarah, seen from behind, appears to be moving away from the scene. The low-keyed colour helps avoid any rhetorical suggestion, while the slow rhythm of the composition creates a sense of inevitability.The city of Cento commissioned this painting, which was then presented to the Cardinal Legate of Ferrara, Lorenzo Imperiali	GUERCINO	Abraham Casting Out Hagar and Ishmael	Oil on canvas, 115 x 154 cm	1657	religious	Italian	1601-1650

21387-lycomed2.jpg	This subject is rare in seventeenth-century Northern Netherlandish art. However, it became extremely popular in Flanders after Rubens' version appeared in c. 1616. There are three known versions of the theme by Lairesse: in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig.The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Knowing her son was destined to die if he went to fight in the Trojan war, Thethis, a sea nymph, disguised Achilles as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes, in whose palace on the isle of Scyros he lived among the king's daughters. Odysseus and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch Achilles. They cunningly laid a heap of gifts before the girls - jewellery, clothes and other finery, but among them a sword, spear and shield. When a trumpet was sounded, Achilles instinctively snatched up the weapons and thus betrayed his identity.Lairesse, like all other artists who rendered the subject, chose the scene Achilles examining the weapons	LAIRESSE, Gérard de	Achilles Discovered among the Daughters of Lycomedes	Oil on canvas, 150 x 181 cm	c. 1685	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

16821-2cesari1.jpg	The Camerino dei Cesari (Chamber of the Caesars) was perhaps the most famous room in Federico Gonzaga's apartment in the Palazzo Ducale. Giulio Romano designed the complex decoration of this room, which centred on frescoed scenes of classical subjects on the vault, now only partially preserved; the series of stuccoed niches around the upper part of the wall, which contained bronze statues, and the famous series of eleven Roman emperors painted by Titian between 1536 and 1540.

38055-sanmarco.jpg	Antonio Stom was a Northern European painter who painted Venetian views in the early decades of the 18th century.

36801-crisosto.jpg	This altarpiece depicts St John Chrysostom with Sts Catherine, Magdalen, Lucy, John the Evangelist, John the Baptist and Theodore. It is a painting with an official, doctrinal message, based on the association of the three Johns. Chrysostom is sitting side on, not in compliance with any mannerist idiosyncrasy but simply to enable us to see and read the book of his golden Word.The altarpiece has at the centre an old man reading, oblivious of the saints around him. It is a tightly knit and crowded group, the slightly yearning figure of St John the Baptist on the right looking inwards is balanced by a trio of grandly assured, superb Venetian beauties looking forwards and outwards at the spectator. The figures are in an architectural setting.This altarpiece is the major work of Sebastiano executed in Venice before he removed to Rome permanently in 1511	SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO	San Giovanni Crisostomo Altarpiece	Oil on canvas, 200 x 156 cm	1510-11	religious	Italian	1501-1550
22597-6madsain.jpg	The work probably dates from the artist's early career. It may be the first indoor sacra conversazione in the history of Italian painting.In Florence in the first half of the fifteenth century the market for devotional images was dominated by sculpture, not painting. Consequently, sculptural reliefs exerted a profound influence on painted compositions of the Madonna and Child. This early painting by Filippo Lippi takes its inspiration from a marble relief from the workshop of Donatello (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) that also exists in molded versions	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	Madonna and Child with Saints, Angels, and a Donor	Panel, 47 x 36 cm	c. 1437	religious	Italian	1401-1450
28703-stilife.jpg	Monnoyer was, in his prime in the 1670s, the foremost still-life painter in Europe, but his skill has been much underestimated in recent years, due to the proliferation of incorrect attributions to him. He specialized in flower pieces of the most elaborate design, although in the early part of his career he produced more conventional still-life paintings, such as the one in the Musée Fabre at Montpellier.The painting was executed in 1665 and submitted to the Academy at the time of the painter's admission in the same year. Following the upheavals of the Revolution in 1789, it was deposited at Montpellier in 1804.

42052-betrotha.jpg	Between 1360 and 1370 Lippo Vanni executed a cycle of fresco paintings for the church of the rural hermitage of San Leonardo al Lago just outside Siena. Painted on the walls and entrance arch of the chancel of this church, the scheme includes narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin, such as the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, the Annunciation, the Betrothal of the Virgin, and the Assumption of the Virgin (over the chancel arch, now badly damaged)	VANNI, Lippo	The Betrothal of the Virgin	Fresco	1360s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
03825-112madon.jpg	The painting, which has been in Bergamo since the 16th century, probably formed part of the dowry of the Carmelite nun Lucrezia Agliardi Vertova, abbess of the Sant'Anna monastery at Albino.On the parapet in front of the Virgin, a detail present in many other similar compositions, there is a fruit. Like the walled and many-towered city on the right, and the inlet on the left, it is a symbol referring to the Virgin, according to the attributes assigned to her by hymns, analects and lauds ever since the Middle Ages. The mother and child are linked, more than by the tender embracing gesture, by the rapt, reflective gaze with which the Madonna engulf her son. The painting is the prototype from which various similar compositions derive, such as the Madonna and Red Angels of the Accademia in Venice, with the child seated on the Virgin's left knee	BELLINI, Giovanni	Madonna and Child	Oil on panel, 83 x 66 cm	1480-90	religious	Italian	1451-1500

15735-ceiling.jpg	With the Peace of Bratislava (1805), Venice was incorporated into the French Empire. It was decided that a new sovereign's residence was required for Napoleon and the viceroy, Eugène de Beauharnais. Once the idea of converting the Palazzo Ducale had been abandoned, the notion was mooted to use the Procuratie Nuove and the Libreria Marciana for this purpose.Apart from Giuseppe Borsato, there were also a number of famous non-Venetians involved in decorating the royal palace. Felice Giani was given the task of painting the new apartment for the viceroy made out of the Libreria Marciana. His figures, full of self-confidence enlivened by quick-witted elements set against the whimsical ornamental scheme by Gaetano Bertolani, contain references to Herculaneum and neo-Renaissance motifs.The picture shows the ceiling decoration for the viceroy's apartment in the former Libreria Marciana	GIANI, Felice	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	1813	other	Italian	1801-1850
19908-06henry8.jpg	"This painting was one of a group of English portraits carried out by Holbein and his school. Though German, Holbein was court painter to King Henry VIII of England, and the prototype for this image is his lost mural that once decorated the Privy Chamber of Whitehall Palace in London. Carried out in 1537, that wall painting depicted the king with his third wife Jane Seymour, the only one of Henry's queens to bear him a male heir. Of the numerous paintings derived from that prototype, including a copy at Windsor Castle, this is without doubt the one of highest quality. The closest example to the prototype, on the other hand, is the portrait in the Thyssen collection in Madrid, which this version approaches especially in the rendering of the details of the collar (these passages were later modified, as is visible through reflectography).The Barberini portrait depicts the king in the same costume that he wore for his April, 1540, wedding to Anne of Cleves. The painting can thus be related to Duren's 1539 marriage portrait of Anne of Cleves (Louvre Museum, Paris), carried out in small dimensions and on canvas as it was meant to be transported.The attribution of the Rome version has been the subject of much discourse. It was considered to be an autograph work of Holbein, a copy of a lost original, the work of the master's workshop, the work of a close collaborator. An official engraving cut after this composition (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), adherent in its details to the Barberini picture, confirms the importance of this version of the image to the iconography of the king. Moreover, reflectographic examination of the painting has revealed characteristic underdrawing and other details that strongly suggest that the work is an autograph Holbein.The painting bears the inscription ""ANNO ETATIS SUAE XLIX"" (His year of age, 49)."

32185-ricardus.jpg	Two Flemish court painters of Bruges descent who earned their reputation abroad, Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569-1622) and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1562-1636), were active at the close of the sixteenth century and especially in the first quarter of the seventeenth. They are linear descendants of famous Bruges painter families. Their solid, old-fashioned technique and the rigid, immovable expression of their figures seem more like an extension of the sixteenth century than a herald of the seventeenth.Frans Pourbus the Younger was Pieter Pourbus' grandson. He was trained in Antwerp and worked briefly for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella before going on to become court painter at Mantua, under Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, and in Paris, under Marie de' Medici and Louis XIII. Until about 1600, Pourbus painted in the smooth and technically brilliant style established by his grandfather, which he augmented with an analytical realism attributable to Adriaan Key. The Portrait of Petrus Ricardus, a famous doctor and professor at the University of Leuven, is a good example of his first period	POURBUS, Frans the Younger	Portrait of Petrus Ricardus	Oil on oak panel, 107 x 77 cm	1592	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

30311-maggiore.jpg	Pannini was one of the most accomplished vedutisti (view-painters) of the eighteenth century. He came from a long tradition of Emilian view-painters and scenery-painters. In 1715 he moved to Rome where he first worked as a decorator painting counterfeit architecture in various palaces. He then found a fuller creative voice by painting scenes of holidays or special events. The spectacular backdrops he used for these works were the squares and buildings of Rome. The beauty of these monumental backgrounds, bathed in clear light that seemed to exalt the very notion of the Eternal City, was so powerful that he had no need of a narrative pretext for them. Many of Pannini's paintings are simple views animated by lively little figures. He had a considerable influence on Canaletto and the great Venetian view-painters of the eighteenth century.

35394-05resur.jpg	Rubens painted this triptych, called Moretus triptych, in 1611-12, shortly after completing the Raising of the Cross, and at more or less the same time as the centre panel of the Descent from the Cross. Martina Plantin, widow of the printer Jan Moretus of the Plantin Press, placed the commission.Christ strides powerfully from his open, rocky tomb rather than the customary sarcophagus. The supernatural radiance of his body contrasts with the darkness that shrouds the astounded soldiers. The panel on the left shows John the baptist, Jan Moretus' patron saint, in his camel-hair tunic by the River Jordan. The sword at his feet is an allusion to his beheading. St Martina, patron saint of Moretus' widow, holds the palm branch that symbolises the martyr.

24109-95magi.jpg	Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame.The subject of Adoration of the Magi was one of the most popular in all fifteenth-century art, especially for the opportunities it presented for the display of rich costumes and accessories, and of numerous subordinate figures with horses and other animals in an extensive landscape. Mantegna, however, restricts his composition to just six figures - with the three magi on the right converging on the three members of the Holy Family on the left - which he shows in half-length, and hence, too, in powerfully expressive close-up. Four decades earlier, when still working as a young man in Padua, Mantegna had introduced this type of half-length devotional narrative into Italian painting with his Presentation in the Temple.It was suggested that this painting was executed for Isabella d'Este, the consort of Marquis Francesco Gonzaga	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Adoration of the Magi	Distemper on canvas, 55 x 71 cm	1495-1505	religious	Italian	1451-1500
16534-s_jerome.jpg	This panel is from the upper register of a reconstructed polyptych. The companion panels in the upper register show Sts Sebastian and Peter, the Crucifixion and St Lawrence. The main panels with which the upper register has been framed since 1925 represent the Madonna and Child with angels, flanked by, on the left, Sts Augustine and Catherine of Alexandria and, on the right, Sts Appolonia and Nicholas of Tolentino.St Jerome is the most moving of the figural panels in the upper register. He is shown with his symbol, the lion, placing its paws on the saint while licking him as would a dog. Jerome is scrutinizing the text of the Vulgate, which he holds in front of him. Staring at the text through gilded pince-nez, his brows knitted in concentration, he reads aloud, his mouth half open, revealing white teeth.The panels forming the upper register come from the Benedictine abbey in Gualdo Tadino, which must have been the original location of the altarpiece to which they belonged	GIOVANNI ANGELO D'ANTONIO	St Jerome	Tempera and gold on panel, 154 x 43 cm	1463-64	religious	Italian	1451-1500

23397-8bathing.jpg	Painting nudes was one of the favourite genres of Károly Lotz, especially during the 1890s he painted several nudes. His female nudes are generally very sensuous, with natural beauty radiating from their gestures. This particular nude is a little abstract; her posture, the cape over the shoulder, and the black stone vessel are reminiscent of the cool grace of Ingres's nudes	LOTZ, Károly	Bathing Woman	Oil on canvas, 180 x 70 cm	1901	other	Hungarian	1851-1900
11256-103delac.jpg	The first of Delacroix's paintings to achieve true notoriety, Dante and Virgil in Hell or The Barque of Dante, exemplifies a duality that pervaded his entire career. The shared influence of Michelangelo and Rubens is manifest here, but there is also a savour of the revolution so thunderously proclaimed by his friend and elder, Theodore Géricault, in his immortal painting, The Raft of the Medusa (1819).The Barque of Dante was submitted to the Salon in 1822, and makes clear acknowledgement of its debt to Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa. Indeed, the influence of that painting can be traced for many years afterwards in Delacroix's work, for example, in his Christ on the Lake of Gennesaret (1854) or The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840). The 'stage-setting' of The Barque of Dante looks forward to Baudelaire's pronouncement that Delacroix is an 'essentially literary' painter. But Delacroix had something much more important to leam from the Raft. In expressing the predicament of the shipwrecked everywhere in the world, Géricault had laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution. The Raft of the Medusa marks the first appearance in painting of 'the ugly' and thereby proclaims its scrupulous respect for the truth, however repulsive the truth might be. This concern for truth is integral to the Romantic temperament.	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	The Barque of Dante	Oil on canvas, 189 x 246 cm	1822	other	French	1801-1850

35185-portuga1.jpg	Antonio Rossellino and his workshop played an important role in the creation of the burial chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal. This elaborate undertaking was the result of the collaboration of an architect (Antonio Manetti), four sculptors (Antonio Rossellino, his brothers Bernardo and Giovanni, and Luca della Robbia), three painters (Alesso Baldovinetti, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo), their workshops, and other craftsmen as well, and yet the chapel today - which looks exactly as it must have looked in the 1470s - is a stylistically unified totality rather than a demonstration of the diverse talents of a number of individuals.James (Jaime), a prince of the Portugal royal family who was made a cardinal at twenty-two, died of tuberculosis in Florence when he was only twenty-five. He had expressed a desire to be buried at San Miniato, and immense sums poured in for his funerary chapel.The chapel was designed by Antonio Manetti, a pupil of Brunelleschi, and the architectural detail was carved by Giovanni Rossellino, third of the five Rossellino brothers. The tomb was designed by Antonio Rossellino, who was helped in the execution by his brother Bernardo, and several assistants. On the altar wall Antonio del Pollaiuolo's frescoed angels pull back curtains that can be related to the curtains that surround Rossellino's tomb on the right wall. The painted altarpiece representing three saints is a work by Antonio del Pollaiuolo (presently a copy, the original being in the Uffizi). On the left wall facing the tomb (not shown in this picture), Alesso Baldovinetti's Annunciation is placed. Baldovinetti decorated also the lunettes and spandrels of the chapel. The inlaid marble floor copies the Cosmati work found in the adjacent church; this pattern is echoed in the composition of Luca della Robbia's enamelled terracotta dome above, which has five medallions representing the Cardinal Virtues and the Descent of the Holy Ghost	ROSSELLINO, Antonio	View of the Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal	White and coloured marbles, width of chapel 480 cm	1460-73	interior	Italian	1451-1500

14432-106fried.jpg	The Cross in the Mountains (The Tetschen Altar) brought Friedrich to the attention of a wider public. Probably at no other point in his life did Friedrich enjoy more profound appreciation and greater admiration than in the years around 1810. Two landscapes in particular were responsible for thrusting Friedrich into the limelight. In 1810 they were exhibited as pendants at the Academy exhibition in Berlin, where they were purchased by the Prussian king Frederick William III. These two paintings were The Monk by the Sea and the Abbey in the Oakwood.The Abbey in the Oakwood is an expression of grief at the loss of a great past. The artist has chosen to depict an architectural ruin; it may testify to the sublimity of the past, but it is a monument in a graveyard.The Napoleonic invasion of Germany and the consequent War of Liberation had added a patriotic dimension to Friedrich's subjects of north German ecclesiastical buildings in ruins or, in imagination, raised again. While the essential message of the Abbey in the Oak-wood of 1810 is the passing of the earthly life, its fog-bound ruin and blasted, leafless trees inevitably evoked the contemporary state of Germany.The painting was exhibited with its companion picture, the Monk by the Sea. This suggests the hope of resurrection in its bright sky, in contrast to the dark clouds that loom above the figure on his Baltic shore	FRIEDRICH, Caspar David	The Abbey in the Oakwood	Oil on canvas, 110 x 171 cm	1809-10	landscape	German	1801-1850

14039-altarpie.jpg	Formerly in Santa Maria delle Grazie at Bergamo, it was removed to the Brera in 1811. The predella and the crowning panel were acquired from the Albani collection in 1811. It is not certain that the predella and the crowning element originally formed part of the same altarpiece; and the accuracy of the entire reconstruction is in doubt. The panels are the following:Central panel: Madonna and Child (165 x 80 cm); side panels: Sts Jerome, Alexander, Vincent, Anthony (137 x 39 cm each); upper side panels: Sts Clare, Bonaventura, Louis, Bernardino (126 x 40 cm each); upper centralaa panel: St Francis (128 x 82 cm); predella panels showing scenes from the Life of Christ (87 x 30 cm each) and two Angels in Adoration (27 x 29 cm each).This altarpiece belongs to Foppa's early stylistic maturity and retains the archaising tendency toward simplification of his youthful period, before he was influenced by Leonardo and Bramante. It also shows the pungent impetuosity of Mantegna's influence in the sharply drawn perspective, and in the tension and almost metallic consistency of the forms. In this resplendent altarpiece, the central panels are particularly fine examples of Foppa's masterly interweaving of colour and light. The Madonna's face, lightly thrown into relief, concludes a series of circling motifs enhanced by the elegant twist of the body of the Child, as he leans over to pluck the string of the lute. In the panel above, St Francis appears as a motionless, somewhat astonished figure immersed in the limpid air of a lyric landscape	FOPPA, Vincenzo	Altarpiece	Tempera on panel	1476	religious	Italian	1451-1500
23474-danishco.jpg	The painting shows a view from Kitnas on Roskilde Fjord, Zeeland. When the painter decided to depict a Danish coastline in an unusually monumental format, the scene was to represent the quintessential characteristic of the Danish countryside: the extensive coastlines. The scene does not, in fact, depict a single, specific site, the main motif is based on cliffs that the artist saw and sketched at the Roskilde Fjord. He adapted these cliffs, making them rather more monumental, and combined them with scenes from elsewhere	LUNDBYE, Johan Thomas	A Danish Coast	Oil on canvas, 189 x 256 cm	1843	landscape	Danish	1801-1850

20645-skagen.jpg	Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris, the modern metropolis with its many-sided art scene. They attended the school of Léon Bonnat, or the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-Léon Gérôme. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grèz-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.Johansen painted with Monet's influence still fresh. Sheep are grazing in the foreground, while on the horizon, which divides the picture in two, we see Skagen with its mill, lighthouse, and the yellow-painted houses with their red tiled roofs	JOHANSEN, Viggo	Near Skagen ?sterby after a Storm	Oil on canvas, 95 x 147 cm	1885	landscape	Danish	1851-1900
11933-painting.jpg	Doré is best known today for his book illustrations, but he himself was most committed to his work as a painter. In 1873-74 he visited Scotland, which inspired him to produce a number of landscapes, including this depiction of a steep gorge. This is a typical example of late Romanticism, a grandiose panoramic mountain landscape, its vast scale indicated by the tiny trees and animals on the slopes	DORÉ, Gustave	Gorge	Oil on copper, 109 x 170 cm	1878	landscape	French	1851-1900
11130-early21.jpg	"Horse racing, a sport of English origin, became popular on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century, and soon inspired such painters as Carle Vernet and Théodore Géricault, who were both influenced by English artists. It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators. This led to the At the Races in the Countryside.Degas never tires of the theme of the racecourse. On September 27, 1881, the newspaper ""Le Globe"" started publishing Major Muybridge's photographs of a galloping horse, and Degas used them for his sketches. The photographs showed that traditional English prints were inaccurate when depicting galloping horses with their front legs outstretched. This is how Degas painted the horses racing in the background of At the Races in the Countryside of 1869.Degas exhibited this moderately colourful work at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The race itself is in the background, the foreground is occupied by a family scene centred on a baby, with the nurse, mother, father and even the dog atop the box. The family is the Valpinçon family: the driver of the carriage is Degas's friend Paul Valpinçon, who is shown with his wife, a wet nurse, and in the nurse's lap, the couple's son, Henri.

33934-atalanta.jpg	In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions.In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her.There are two versions of this paining, one in Naples and another in Madrid, and recently there have been heated debates about both their autography and dating. While most scholars recognize the Madrid canvas as an autograph work, there have been serious reservations about the Neapolitan canvas, deemed it a workshop copy.

12114-du_barry.jpg	"Jeanne Bécu, comtesse du Barry (1743-1793), was the mistress of Louis XV. She was the natural daughter of a poor woman of Vaucouleurs. Placed in a convent in Paris at an early age, she received a very slight education, learning little but the catechism and drawing; and at the age of sixteen entered a milliner's shop in the rue St Honoré. Subsequently she lived as a courtesan under the name of Mlle Lange. Her great personal charms led the adventurer Jean, comte du Barry, to take her into his house in order to make it more attractive to the dupes whose money he won by gambling. Her success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a higher flight, and through Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV, and the duc de Richelieu, he succeeded in installing her as mistress of the king. In order to present her at court it was necessary to find a title for her, and as Count Jean du Barry was married, his brother Guillaume offered himself as nominal husband. The comtesse du Barry was presented at court on the 22nd of April 1769, and became official mistress of the king.Her influence over the monarch was absolute until his death in 1774 when an order of his successor banished her to the abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, but, the queen interceding for her, the king in the following year gave her permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Here she led a retired life with the comte de Cosse-Brissac, and was visited there by Benjamin Franklin and the emperor Joseph II, among many other distinguished men.Having gone to England in 1792 to endeavour to raise money on her jewels, she was on her return accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal of having dissipated the treasures of the state, conspired against the republic, and worn, in London, ""mourning for the tyrant."" She was condemned to death by guillotine on the 8th of December 1793, and beheaded the same evening.By the time the comtesse du Barry had arrived at Versailles, Drouais had completed posthumously the last portrait of Madame de Pompadour, a sumptuous affair that surely qualifies as his masterpiece. It was fitting that the new royal paramour would choose as her official portraitist an artist who could immortalize her predecessor with such refinement and elegance. She commissioned him to paint for both the ch&#226;teau and the pavilion of Luciennes a series of delightful pictures. During the comtesse du Barry's years at court, Drouais created five distinct portraits of her, as well as additional copies of the five images"	DROUAIS, François-Hubert	Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry	Oil on canvas, 71 x 59 cm	1770-74	portrait	French	1701-1750

03597-1trinity.jpg	In a theme that was majestically treated by Masaccio a century earlier, Beccafumi does not retain an orderly sense of scale for his figures, so that God the Father and the crucified Christ are much smaller in relation to the side saints (Sts Cosmas and John the Baptist at left, Sts John the Evangelist and Damian at right). All of his figures seem to deny pure volumetric presence, this despite the fact that Beccafumi was accomplished both as a bronze sculptor and painter	BECCAFUMI, Domenico	Trinity	Oil on wood, 152 x 228 cm	1513	religious	Italian	1501-1550
02618-03arella.jpg	While paintings of flowers in a vase represented the most conventional type of flower piece in the 17th century, in the pair of Vase of Flowers, now in the same private collection, Arellano has depicted particularly rich arrangements in remarkably ornate bulbous glass vases with gilt mounts. The paintings could be surrogates for actual flower arrangements in the homes of wealthy contemporaries.The apparently natural floral arrangements seen in these paintings were the result of Arellano's careful ordering of the flowers. He derived this type of composition from his study of earlier Flemish flower paintings and prints, and varied it little throughout his career. It is hard to distinguish the flowers he painted from nature from those deriving from other pictures, graphic sources, memory and practice.While the repetitive nature of Arellano's still-lifes would not have been noticed in his own time, when his works were dispersed among different collections, this factor is augmented in pictures united by photography and exhibitions	ARELLANO, Juan de	Vase of Flowers	Oil on canvas, 82 x 62,5 cm	1664	still-life	Spanish	1601-1650
10201-charity1.jpg	From 1529 Lucas Cranach the Elder, and his son Lucas the Younger depicted the Christian virtue of Love, Caritas or Charitas, in some dozen different versions. It happened only in individual pictures, where Caritas (Charity) does not appear in the company of the seven (or more) virtues and vices. The earlier clothed personification - the idealised figure of a woman - has been replaced by the picture of a young mother. She sits in blissful nakedness on a stone bench, her legs modestly crossed, with only a thin veil covering her head and shoulders. She breastfeeds her baby and allows two somewhat larger boys to cling on her.This composition later appeared in many other versions. The present version is amongst the earliest of Cranach's numerous variants of Caritas pictures.

The second, likewise a triumphal procession was finished a year later. Finally, in 1651, he painted a grisaille of putti.

06682-v_lawyer.jpg	Pieter Breughel the Younger (the sons adopted a different spelling of the family name) specialized in copies of his father's work, though he ought really to be pictured as the head of a workshop in which a number of painters were employed. Some of these were more talented than others, which explains the substantial differences in quality between the many copies ascribed to him. The Village Lawyer, dated 1621, is believed to be an original work by Pieter the Younger rather than a copy. It too proved very popular and many versions of it have survived	BRUEGHEL, Pieter the Younger	Village Lawyer	Oil on panel, 74,8 x 122 cm	1621	genre	Flemish	1551-1600
34269-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.Undoubtedly Sebastiano Ricci's dashing virtuoso technique had its roots in the Baroque. In his hands, however, it was translated into an explosive, light-hearted energy.	RICCI, Sebastiano	Fall of Phaethon	Oil on canvas	1703-04	religious	Italian	1701-1750

07213-canal501.jpg	The painting depicts the scene when the doge, accompanied by the senators, visits the church and Scuola di San Rocco on the occasion of the feastday of the Saint.The church of San Rocco at the right has housed the body of St Roch since 1485. In 1576 there was a very severe outbreak of the plague in Venice, and it was thought that his intercession prevented an even greater calamity, so from that year onwards his Feast day, 16 August, was celebrated by the Republic. Canaletto here depicts one aspect of the festivities - a procession of resplendent dignitaries emerging from the church after they have attended Mass.The Scuola di San Rocco dominates the centre of the composition; its exterior is decorated with garlands and paintings, as was the custom on this occasion. Canaletto and his artist nephew Bellotto are recorded as having sold some of their works at one of these exhibitions. Many of the figures walking before it and beneath the awning can be identified because of their distinctive and colourful clothes. They are, from left to right: Secretaries, who wear mauve; the Doge's chair- and cushion-bearers; the Cancelliere Grande who wears scarlet; the Doge himself in gold and ermine; the Guardiano Grande di San Rocco; the bearer of the sword of state; the Senators; and finally the Ambassadors. A number of them carry nosegays, which were presented as reminders of the plague; they were carried during outbreaks of the disease because it was believed that their scent helped prevent its spread.Canaletto shows an expansive view of this scene which could not, in fact, be observed, because the church of the Frari impinges too far on the near side of the square.

10399-05adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht Dürer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike Dürer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Eve	Oil on lime wood panel, 171 x 63 cm	after 1537	religious	German	1501-1550
41182-zhairy1.jpg	"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome. The portraits of the couple's two oldest children, Maddalena (born c. 1575) and Enrico (born c. 1580), who inherited their father's condition, are in the Archduke's collection"	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	"The ""Hairy Man from Munich"""	Paper on cardboard, 13 x 10 cm	1580s	portrait	German	1551-1600

As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

29281-213muril.jpg	Murillo's Immaculada has nothing of a Queen of Heavens. Standing on a crescent moon, as described in the Apocalypse, surrounded by angels holding the mirror as a sign of purity and the palm frond as a sign of suffering, she stands in a relatively unaffected poses. Her face is pale, her eyes gaze upwards in yearning. We can sense the pain she has experienced and her mourning for her son. Quiet and introverted, she epitomises the humble anticipation of the hereafter, transfigured only by a mild smile, that is a hallmark of Murillo's paintings of this period; the 'Estilo vaporoso' - the vaporous style	MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban	Immaculate Conception	Oil on canvas, 96 x 64 cm	-	religious	Spanish	1651-1700

35291-youngirl.jpg	Pietro Rotari, born in Verona, was one of the Venetian Settecento masters who travelled extensively. His enchanting genre pieces, his half-length portraits of young girls enjoyed wide popularity, particularly in Vienna, Dresden and later in St. Petersburg, where the artist stayed for several years. He also painted large religious compositions and mythological scenes, but his fame rested on the small pictures usually produced in series, in which, as in the Budapest painting, a pretty young girl was represented with a distaff or reading a letter, perhaps slumbering or leaning over her book. In these works an appealing pose was coupled with fine, pure design and warm colouring	ROTARI, Pietro Antonio	Young Girl with Distaff	Oil on canvas, 48 x 39 cm	-	portrait	Italian	1701-1750

35735-waterfa.jpg	This is one of Ruisdael grandest landscapes.After Ruisdael had settled in Amsterdam about 1656-57 his compositions broaden, and a certain heaviness in the foreground disappears. The opening of the view suggests that he was impressed by Philips Koninck's panoramic views, but the fresh atmospheric effect, the brilliant glittering daylight which brightens the landscapes, the reflections, and vivid colours in the shadows are completely personal. In the late fifties Ruisdael also began to represent waterfalls in mountainous northern valleys, and in the sixties they became an important theme in his oeuvre. This motif was popularized by Allart van Everdingen after he returned to Holland in 1644 from a trip to Norway and Sweden, and Ruisdael, who never visited Scandinavia, derived his torrential falls in northern landscapes from Everdingen's art	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Landscape with Waterfall	Oil on canvas, 101 x 142 cm	c. 1670	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
09848-courb111.jpg	"The subtitle of the huge painting is Real Allegory of Seven Years of My Artistic and Moral Life. Courbet did not like to talk about his art, but made an exception for this work: ""It is the moral and physical story of my studio. ... it is the world that comes to be painted. .. .The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are... friends... On the left, the other world of trivial life...""In 1854, Courbet began work on The Studio which he would like to submit for the Exposition universelle. Courbet described the painting in a letter: ""I see society with its concerns and passions; it is the world that comes to be painted.... The scene takes place in my atelier in Paris. The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are the shareholders, that is, friends, workers, devotees of the art world. On the left, the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.""The Studio presents a completely original synthesis and a thoroughly unexpected confrontation. There is no parallel in Courbet's later career for this generous, indeed baroque, vision, in which models and minds come together. Courbet sought to present the studio as an overall image of the role of art. He declared the autonomy and subjectivity of his perception in the face of history and the real world, both of which he had in his own way summoned into the studio. The master of ceremonies is seen painting a landscape, a practice that was to become increasingly central during the rest of his life. Meanwhile, the notion of a group portrait as homage or allegory in the spirit of Frans Hals, Rembrandt or Philippe de Champaigne, is perfectly achieved.The painting was a success at the Exposition, however, it did not find a buyer, remaining rolled up in a corner of the rue Hautefeuille studio till 1881, when Courbet's sister Juliette, his sole heir, decided to sell it. By then it had become something of a burden. It raised 21,000 francs (some 3,200 euros).

38536-2allegor.jpg	Abraham van den Tempel painted a series of three allegorical history pieces for the governors of the Lakenhal, or Clothmakers' Hall in Leiden between 1648 and 1651. The commission was a prestigious one, not only because of the size of the pictures, but also because they were history pieces to be displayed in a high ranking public building. The governors who commissioned the work were men of considerable stature, too. They were entrusted by the city fathers with the day-to-day management of one of Leiden's nine textile sectors, known in Dutch as 'neringen'. In this capacity they were responsible for the manufacture of and trade in worsted, a sector that was booming at the time. Their seat of office was the brand-new building which has been known to this day as the Lakenhal. They wanted classicist decorations worthy of their modern building.Regarding the series, Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden originally served as the overmantel, while the other two, Mars Banishes 'Nering' and The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' hung on the long wall beside one another. The latter two paintings form pendants, being the same size and related in subject-matter. The theme that connects them is 'nering', the term formerly used in Leiden for the production of and trade in textile.Whereas the Mars Banishes 'Nering' illustrates the misfortune caused by war, the painting The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' embodies the antithesis, where freedom, justice and peace foster trade and industry. Here Minerva and Mercury return as witnesses of the principal scene in which the Maid of Leiden stands on a step in her purple gown and crimson mantel and extends a hand to Nering, while Liberty, with her broken weapons and the hat symbolising freedom, kneels at her feet. Under her arm Nering clutches a bound volume containing the statutes establishing the worsted nering in 1638	TEMPEL, Abraham van den	The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering'	Oil on canvas, 207 x 267 cm	1651	historical	Dutch	1651-1700
03546-05family.jpg	This is perhaps the most famous painting by Bazille. It depicts a family in the shade on a terrace at Méric, near Montpellier in the south of France. The painting was accepted at the 1868 Salon. The picture, showing Bazille's parents and relations, conveys a sense of family and of social status, a particular lifestyle, and a fresh response to Nature and light; in painting it, Bazille was also out to convince his family of his ability as an artist	BAZILLE, Jean-Frédéric	Family Gathering	Oil on canvas, 152 x 230 cm	1867	portrait	French	1851-1900
25082-doctors.jpg	The attribution of the fresco is debated. Originally Vasari attributed it to Cimabue, however, this attribution was rejected at the end of the 18th century. Since then some critics attributed it to Pietro Cavallini or one of his followers; Jacopo Torriti or a follower, the young Giotto or a follower.  In the four compartments of the vault in the entrance bay the artist portrays the four Doctors of Church together with their scribes: in the south (at the top of the illustration) St Augustine and opposite him, St Ambrose; in the east (to the left) St Jerome, and in the west St Gregory. The architectural structures jut up from below into the gold background. The painter conveys a definite idea of the intellectual work of these saints through the great attention to detail and the perspectival accuracy.The picture shows the vault before the 1997 earthquake	MASTER of the Isaac Stories	Vault with the Church Fathers	Fresco	c. 1295	religious	Italian	1251-1300

42510-hagar_is.jpg	A series of recent studies has led to something of a new attitude towards Flemish painting in the 18th century. Until fairly recently, the art of this period was considered to be rather inferior, despite the high artistic output, because of its perceived lack of innovation. On the one hand, Flemish artists of the 18th century continued to live off the inheritance of Rubens, whose art seemed unsurpassable. Artists such as Pieter Jozef Verhaghen worked entirely in the tradition of Rubens, and although he spent a few years in Italy, there are few traces of this in his work. His Hagar and Ishmael banished by Abraham, painted for the abbey at Tongerlo, has all the outward characteristics of a baroque painting, but lacks Rubens expressiveness. Meanwhile, other artists had fallen under the spell of France with its trend-setting rococo artists. This development was, however, rather out of character with Flemish artistic tradition	VERHAGHEN, Pieter Jozef	Hagar and Ishmael Banished by Abraham	Oil on canvas, 168 x 195 cm	1781	religious	Flemish	1751-1800

16101-mary07.jpg	"In the upper section of the lunette above the chancel arch God the Father enthroned is painted, while the sides of the lunette are occupied by the scene of the Annunciation.The border between painted and real space appears to have been breached in Giotto's frescoes. This characterizes the representation of God the Father at the top of the triumphal arch wall above the entrance to the choir. The heavens have opened and ranks of angels surround God the Father on his throne. Amongst the angels, who move elegantly, the depiction of God, with his delicately shimmering, bright robes and his hieratic face, gives the impression of his belonging to a different sphere.This particular effect is also the result of a different painting technique: God the Father is not painted as a fresco on the wall, but in tempera on a wooden panel. This ""door"" was presumably opened during the mystery plays performed to celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation, in order that the dove of Annunciation could fly out. The representation of the Annunciation directly below it is an indication of this. In a magnificent way, Giotto here combines the real architecture of the church interior with feigned, painted architectural elements to create a meaningful unity. To the right and left of the arch, the angel and Mary kneel in their respective buildings. It is only through the connecting architecture that tension is maintained within the depiction of the Annunciation, even over this great, daring distance and separation of figures, and that God the Father &#151; at the top of the triumphal arch &#151; is also included in the action. As far as form and content were concerned, Giotto was even here entering new territory"	GIOTTO di Bondone	No. 13 God Sends Gabriel to the Virgin	Fresco, 230 x 690 cm	1306	religious	Italian	1301-1350
10212-2nymph1.jpg	The resurgence of Gothic linear rhythms is fundamental for the whole of Cranach's later work, in which the borderline between sacred and mundane art is blurred. He represented female saints as beautiful and elegant ladies in fashionable dress and covered with jewelry. His  Reclining River Nymph at the Fountain (1518 Leipzig) shows with what assurance he translated a Renaissance model - Giorgione's Venus - into his personal language of linear arabesque. This work inaugurated a long series of paintings of Venus, Lucretia, the Graces, the Judgment of Paris, and other subjects that serve as pretexts for the sensuous female nude, in which Cranach appears as a kind of 16th-century François Boucher. There exists several copy of this painting made by the workshop of Cranach.

08628-s_emmaus.jpg	This Supper at Emmaus has been attributed to Philippe de Champaigne, although some art historians consider it to be the work of his nephew and pupil Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne (1631-1681 or 1684). Both artists were born in Brussels and settled in Paris. The Rubensian influence in Champaigne's work is tempered by a classical purity informed by both the artistic influence of Nicolas Poussin and de Champaigne's Jansenist beliefs. The artist performed a number of commissions for the Jansenist monastery of Port Royal, near Paris, including a painting of The Supper at Emmaus, possibly the version in Ghent.

36142-february.jpg	"Sandrart, best known for his major art history published in 1675 under the title ""Teutsche Academie"" is one of the few artist-writers whose painterly oeuvre was on a par with his literary ambitions.For Prince Maximilian of Bavaria, Sandrart painted allegories of day and night as well as a cycle of twelve paintings of the months of the year for the dining room of the Old Palace in Schleissheim. The months, accompanied by verses, were widely distributed in the form of engravings. They are illustrated by life-size half figures set in landscapes or interiors and show characteristic activities associated with the respective seasons and surrounded by their natural attributes. November, under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius the hunter, shows a hunter's return. With his nervous dogs on a short leash and his catch slung over his shoulder, he is heading towards a castle in the middle distance. A keen wind tears the leaves from the trees and scatters them through the air.Landscape and genre, still-life and allegory are combined in a picture that epitomizes the month of November in concentrated form.

03437-08lucill.jpg	An extraordinary burst of light bounces off the characters, casting silky reflections on the robes and making the gold glimmer. The painter produced this masterpiece when he was well into his middle age. It gives us tremendous insight into his enormously innovative power which fell between popular realism and magical effects. It is astounding to think Jacopo Bassano was able to produce paintings of this stature when he was so removed from the major centres of art	BASSANO, Jacopo	St Valentine Baptizing St Lucilla	Oil on canvas	c. 1575	religious	Italian	1551-1600
21928-6carnat.jpg	"A work that would seem to evoke the sketches of a young Leonardo freed from Verrocchio's tutelage, though nevertheless still affected by a passion and taste for the soft textures and dazzle of solid material (as practiced in the workshop of the Florentine artist), is the Madonna sometimes referred to as the Madonna of the Carnation or ""Madonna of the flowers"".This painting is a free variant of the Benois Madonna in the Hermitage, being more complex in its composition and spatial arrangement, though perhaps somewhat highflown and less spontaneous. How it arrived at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, after its acquisition by a private German collector, is unknown to us. What is certain is that after a comprehensible, temporary attribution to Verrocchio or his shop, art critics subsequently almost universally assigned the painting to Leonardo, a jjudgment backed up by the most recent research. In fact, the richness of the drapery, the vastness of the mountain scenery with purple and gold hues tingeing the foothills of peaks that fade into the sky, the vitality of the cut flowers in the crystal vase and the softness of the Child's flesh that foreshadows the tender putti of the Virgin of the Rocks, are elements that show a distancing from the more distinctive Verrocchiesque style and instead assume those formal and chromatic characteristics that would be the mature Leonardo's very own. Moreover, we should not overlook the striking similarities - in facial features and other details - with the Benois Madonna already mentioned (the gem fastening the Virgin's gown over her breast) and with the Uffizi Annunciation, works that in their figurative and expressive invention quite clearly reveal the stamp of Leonardo"	LEONARDO da Vinci	The Madonna of the Carnation	Oil on panel, 62 x 47,5 cm	1478-80	religious	Italian	1451-1500

33028-06forna.jpg	"Much of Raphael's energy during his last years was directed toward public activity, or at least toward commissioners who were influential in city life and life within the Papal States (he designed a villa, known as the Villa Madama, for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici). Furthermore, many critics attribute to him a series of compositions of the Holy Family and of Saints which were then executed by his followers. The famous portrait of a young woman, called La Fornarina, must also be viewed in this perspective, although it is signed, in Latin, ""Raphael from Urbino"". The signature is engraved on the thin ribbon that the girl wears just under her left shoulder. Tradition identifies her with Margherita Luti, a Sienese woman whom Raphael loved, the daughter of a baker from the Roman district of Santa Dorotea. The stiffness of her features and the heavy chiaroscuro effect make La Fornarina an almost certain workshop piece with the contribution of Raphael, for Raphael's own work from this period is far more delicate.There are several old copies of this painting, the most famous in the Galleria Borghese"	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	Portrait of a Young Woman (La Fornarina)	Oil on wood, 85 x 60 cm	1518-19	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

37129-60portra.jpg	Very few portraits survive from Signorelli's hand. Indubitably his finest is the Portrait of an Elderly Man, probably of a humanist. It is often said to be of a jurist, that profession and humanism considered practically inseparable. Victories before a temple approach athletes in front of a triumphal arch, these all'antica themes pertinent to the sitter's scholarly calling or pretensions. The action taking place in the background may be on his mind, as suggested by his downcast eyes. The hard-won balance between hat, head, V-shaped scarf, and the far-smaller figures is among the major triumphs of his great portrait	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Portrait of an Elderly Man	Poplar, 50 x 32 cm	c. 1492	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
42339-the_hut.jpg	Unlike his elder brother Willem and their father Willem van de Velde the Elder, both famous marine artists, Adriaen chose to landscapes, which he did at least as well as his father and brother did in their genre. He was also a magnificent painter of figures and animals which he included in his compositions in a carefully balanced way.Adriaen van de Velde made many preliminary studies, generally in red or black chalk, of cows oxen, sheep and landscapes going out into the countryside.

18234-0504grec.jpg	Painted for the attic of the High Altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, Toledo, to go above the Assumption. Probably painted 1577-78, following the Assumption. It was El Greco's first commission upon his arrival in Toleedo in 1577. It gained great fame in Toledo, which was artistically rather archaic and provincial, and established a successful career for El Greco in the town.Here the reference is to Rome, rather than to Venice, and specifically to Michelangelo, developing the motif of the Piet&#224;. The general scheme of the composition of the Trinity, however, refers to Dürer's engraving of the same subject. The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. Form is more in evidence here than in the Assumption, especially in the Michelangelesque motif of the naked Christ (for which the artist probably drew inspiration from Michelangelo's  Piet&#224; for Vittoria Colonna), and it is only later that he treats his figures with the same freedom as draperies. Here the suggestion of weight in the supported Dead Christ is appropriate. The stress on the dead body of Christ, together with the clamorous mannerist colors and the rather loose composition of the figures, produces a feverish pathos.El Greco was not to repeat this subject	GRECO, El	The Trinity	Oil on canvas, 300 x 179 cm	1577	religious	Spanish	1551-1600

34278-3bathshe.jpg	Attended by four maids and on the far right, a boy with a mirror, Uriah's beautiful wife, Bathsheba, devotes herself to her elaborate toilette in an enclosed garden. The sight of Bathsheba inflamed King David's desire, and he is usually depicted in a palace-window in the background. Here, however, a maid approaches on the far left with a letter from the king.The painting dates from about 1725 and thus belongs to the artist's late period: its refinement of form and colour is reminiscent of the golden age of Venetian painting in the 16th century, in particular of Veronese. One of the most influential painters of his time, Ricci was well on the road to international success by the turn of the 17th century. His career took him to Parma, Bologna, Rome, Milan, Florence, Venice and London.

40944-11medusa.jpg	From an early point, museums endeavoured to add the name of Leonardo to their collections. As early as 1782 this panel in the museum's depository was linked to a head of Medusa by Leonardo da Vinci which Vasari mentions. It is likely, though, that a well-read Netherlandish artist had read the biographer's description of the monster that is said to have frightened Leonardo's father, and amalgamated it and an independent head of Medusa to produce this painting	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Head of Medusa	Oil on panel, 49 x 74 cm	16th century	other	Flemish	1551-1600

38600-kermis.jpg	Depictions of the 'kermis' or rural fair belong to an iconographic and compositional tradition founded in the Netherlands in about 1550 by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. So when David Teniers painted his first country fair in i637, his native town of Antwerp could already look back on an almost century-long tradition in this genre.The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn shown here demonstrates how Teniers had grown away from Adriaen Brouwer and developed his own style, distinguished primarily by a lighter overall tone and warmer, more radiant colours. The scale of his figures is somewhat reduced in his village scenes, so that they fit more convincingly into his broad, expansive landscapes with their subtly shaded atmospheres. The festivities are being held here in a square, bounded on two sides by a wooden fence, in front of a village tavern similar to that in many other Flemish kermis paintings. A path leads off to the left in the direction of Antwerp Cathedral, which gives the rural festivities a local and municipal frame of reference. The sky, with its vivid stretches of cloud and the gold-tinged light of the evening on the left, is given a special weight, which lends the scene a cool, airy atmosphere and a festive mood.The joyful, lively antics of the farmers are not based on Teniers's own observations, but are pieced together from the handed-down repertoire of motifs for this genre, which were constantly varied and modified. They include the musicians standing on their podium, the three couples doing a round dance in the foreground, the drunk who is being helped home by two farmers, and the man who is leaning by the fence in an attack of nausea. At the end of the canvas on the right edge we also see the motif of the 'unequal couple': Teniers had already used lecherous old farmers hugging young girls as a single motif for a painting	TENIERS, David the Younger	The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn	Oil on canvas, 93 x 132 cm	1641	genre	Flemish	1651-1700
19142-37malle.jpg	"The name ""Malle Babbe van Haarlem"", which could be translated as Silly Betty or Mad Meg of Haarlem, is inscribed on an old piece of stretcher let into the modern one supporting the canvas in Berlin. In 1653, the Haarlem burgomasters allowed the local ""Workhouse"" (which was both a house of correction and a charitable institution) 65 guilders to care for Malle Babbe. The document also refers to Frans Hals mentally impaired son, Pieter, who had been confined in the same place since 1642. Thus a real person served as the model for Hals's painting in Berlin and for a number of related works. The owl was a common symbol of folly in the Netherlands, despite its classical association with Minerva, goddess of wisdom.This picture shows Hals supreme mastery of one of the principal preoccupations of Baroque artists: the rendering of instantaneous emotion and movement. No seventeenth-century artist surpassed Hals in this fields. Hals's vigorous concentration on this was more than an ordinary rendering of reality. He selected moments when human nature reveals all its vital energy. Most frequently he shows the instant when the joy of life is at its highest: the spontaneous laughter of a child, the smile of a courtesan, or the wild shriek of an old crone, like in this painting"	HALS, Frans	Malle Babbe	Oil on canvas, 75 x 64 cm	1633-35	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

23361-01lucret.jpg	"According to Roman legend, Lucretia, who was the wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, was raped by the son of the Roman king - a dishonour which subsequently resulted in her suicide. The event is supposed to have precipitated the collapse of the Etruscan royal line (510 BC) and thus to have led to the founding of the Roman Republic.In the 16th and 17th century Lucretia was frequently portrayed as a symbol of purity. Lotto presents us with the three-quarter view of a woman dressed in fine, richly trimmed clothes. Turned slightly away from the viewer, in her left hand she holds a drawing of the naked Lucretia about to stab herself in the heart. An inscription in Latin on the sheet on the table reads: ""Following Lucretia's example, no dishonoured woman should continue to live"".In the exquisiteness of its palette, the painting ranks amongst Lotto's greatest works. While the subject's face follows on from the tradition of Giorgione, the contrast between her brightly lit shoulders and the richly gradated reds and greens of her dress is worthy of a Titian. The costly pendant suspended from the gold chain, its precious stones refracting the light, is virtually without equal in 16th-century Venetian painting"	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Portrait of a Lady as Lucretia	Oil on canvas, 96 x 111 cm	1530-32	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
03195-aeneas.jpg	Federico Barrocci's Aeneas' Flight from Troy with Anchises, his son Ascanius and his wife Creusa is the second version painted in 1598 of a picture executed ten years earlier for Emperor Rudolf II of Austria. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere presented Cardinal Scipione with this second version, which entered the Borghese collection before 1613. It was this painting that inspired Cardinal Scipione to commission a large marble group on the same subject from Gian Lorenzo Bernini (also in the Borghese Gallery). The myth of Aeneas, ancestor of Romulus and Remus, referred to the birth of Rome and thus confirmed the Borghese family's high status in the city.Barrocci's many drawings of nature led him to achieve a spontaneity and naturalness in movement, colour and airy effects, and a silvery luminosity that was to influence the 17th-century masters, particularly Rubens. Never before had flames been painted so close to, with an energy suggesting even the crackle of the fire, from which Ascanius seems to be protecting himself by covering his ears. But the human delicacy of Barrocci's anti-heroic and anti-rhetorical figures was not to be really appreciated in Rome, because it could not compete with the classical antique statuary	BAROCCI, Federico Fiori	Aeneas' Flight from Troy	Oil on canvas, 179 x 253 cm	1598	mythological	Italian	1551-1600

06485-01weddin.jpg	Painted about 1567, this picture has traditionally been thought of simply as a depiction of peasant life. However, it seems likely that, in addition to the obvious celebration of peasant life, the picture has a moral dimension - the celebration of the sacrament of marriage has simply become an excuse for self-indulgence. Whereas in his earlier engraved work Bruegel represented the Vices as elaborate allegories peopled by Boschian monsters, here human weakness is commented on in an understated, naturalistic and humorous manner.The wedding feast is dominated by the figure of the bride who, radiant and composed, presides over the table beneath a canopy. Less obvious is the identity of the bridegroom; he may be the man in black, with his back to the spectator, leaning back on his stool, mug in hand, calling for more wine. The feast is taking place in the barn, the wall behind the guests consisting of stacked-up straw or corn. Two ears of corn with a rake call to the mind work that harvesting involves. The plates are being carried around on a door taken off its hinges. The principal form of nourishment in those day consisted of bread, porridge and soup.A curious detail of the scene which has never been satisfactorily explained is the presence on the far right of a richly-dressed nobleman in earnest conversation with a monk. The monk has presumably just conducted the service of marriage and it has been suggested that he is tediously reminiscing about previous weddings he has attended to the local landowner.

03914-207feas.jpg	"The Feast of the Gods was Giovanni Bellini's last great  painting and one of only a few that he executed on canvas. It was the first in a series of mythologies or bacchanals commissioned by Duke Alfonso d'Este to decorate the camerino d'alabastro, or alabaster study, of his castle in Ferrara. The artist, whose career began in the 1450s, was trained to paint on wooden panels, which require a very meticulous application of pigment. When he worked on canvas late in his career, Bellini retained his tight, precise brushwork. The flesh tones, iridescent silks, and even the foreground pebbles here demonstrate his delicate touch.According to the current interpretations, the scene illustrates a passage from Ovid's Fasti (The Feasts), a long classical poem that recounts the origins of many  ancient Roman rites and festivals. Ovid (43 B.C. - A.D. 17), describing a banquet given by the god of wine, mentioned an incident that embarrassed Priapus, god of  virility.The beautiful nymph Lotis, shown reclining at the far right, was lulled to sleep by wine. Priapus, overcome by lust, seized the opportunity to take advantage of her and is portrayed bending forward to lift her skirt. His attempt was foiled when an ass, seen at the left, ""with raucous braying, gave out an ill-timed roar. Awakened, the startled nymph pushed Priapus away, and the god was laughed at by all."" Priapus, his pride wounded, took revenge by demanding the annual sacrifice of a donkey.The ass stands next to Silenus, a woodland deity who used the beast to carry wood, thus wears a keg on his belt because he was a follower of Bacchus, god of wine. Bacchus himself, seen as an infant, kneels before them while decanting wine into a crystal pitcher.Reading from left to right, the principal figures are:Silenus, a woodland god attended by his donkeyBacchus, the infant god of wine crowned with grape leavesFaunus or Silvanus, an old forest god wearing a wreath of pine needlesMercury, the messenger of the gods carrying his caduceus or herald's staffJupiter, the king of the gods accompanied by an eagleAn unidentified goddess holding a quince, a fruit associated in the ancient world with marriagePan, a satyr with a grape wreath who blows on his shepherd's pipesNeptune, the god of the sea sitting beside his trident harpoonCeres, the goddess of cereal grains with a wreath of wheatApollo, god of the sun and the arts, crowned by laurel and holding a Renaissance stringed musical instrument, the lira da braccio, in lieu of a classical lyrePriapus, the god of virility and of vineyards with a scythe, used to prune orchards, hanging from the tree above himLotis, one of the naiads, a nymph of fresh waters who represents chastity.These deities are waited upon by three naiads, nymphs of streams and brooks, and two satyrs, goat-footed inhabitants of the wilderness.

24177-clement9.jpg	Apart from demonstrating the favours granted by important Roman patrons, Maratti's portraits are also perhaps the most lively and penetrating part of his work. He took pains to capture the exact physiognomy of his sitters in whom he sometimes seemed to uncover an incurable feeling of melancholy hiding just below the surface. Here his admiration for Raphael's portraits is evident, but he has added a more stylish air to suit the tastes of the high Baroque.The painting was executed shortly before the death of the Pope who was on the throne from 1667 to 1669. It is signed on the paper sheet on the table	MARATTI, Carlo	Portrait of Pope Clement IX	Oil on canvas, 158 x 119 cm	1669	portrait	Italian	1651-1700
15755-tobias_a.jpg	The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight	GIAQUINTO, Corrado	Tobias and the Angel	Oil on canvas, 58 x 48 cm	c. 1740	religious	Italian	1701-1750
11538-laidtabl.jpg	The aesthetically conservative principle of tables arranged strictly parallel to the horizontal edges of the painting was followed by Nicolaes Gillis and Floris Claesz van Dijck. (Predecessors were probably family paintings such as Marten van Heemskerck's.) Their still-lifes are classified as 'ontbijtjes' (breakfast still-lifes). Onbijt(je) was a light meal which could be taken at any time of the day. Strictly speaking, most of the paintings by Gillis and van Dijck are dessert still-lifes, developed at roughly the time by Osias Beert and Clara Peeters.All these artists show a table with a table runner and a carefully ironed, white damask tablecloth whose creases, regardless of the laws of perspective, run in parallel lines towards the back of the painting. A relatively high viewpoint was also chosen, apparently to afford a good overall survey of the objects, which are arranged side by side, or in a circle, hardly ever touching or overlapping. The precious drinking vessels and pieces of textile show very clearly that the arrangement is that of a privileged household.In accordance with etiquette, fruit, pies, nuts and confectionery were served as a dessert. Cheese, which had a central role in Gillis's and van Dijck's art, was also part of the dessert. Gillis and van Dijck build up pyramids of hard cheese in two or three layers: at the bottom there is half a large cheese with a rich, yellow hue, indicating that it is still very young, while on the top the cheeses are smaller and more brownish, almost grey in colour, showing that they are older and more mature. The irregular traces of cuts with a knife - the only piece of cutlery on the table - are rendered extremely well	DIJCK, Floris Claesz van	Laid Table	Oil on wood, 100 x 135 cm	1622	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
34260-bacchan2.jpg	The pair of canvases, depicting The Bacchanal in Honour of Pan and The Feast of Silenus, were commissioned by the celebrated patron of the arts, Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg (1661-1747). A German aristocrat and general of the Saxon and Venetian armies, Schulenburg settled in Venice upon his retirement where he began to amass a spectacular collection, acquiring paintings by the likes of Raphael, Giorgione and Correggio. In addition to the present canvases, Ricci painted two further versions of these pendants	RICCI, Sebastiano	Feast of Silenus	Oil on canvas, 99 x 114 cm	-	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
17035-flower08.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 213, JH 1247.Van Gogh arrived in Paris in March 1886. Although he was able to see a considerable amount of contemporary French painting by the Impressionists and their followers - Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte was exhibited twice in 1886 - he took little notice for at least a year. As a letter written to an English artist he had met in Antwerp reveals, he continued with what he had been doing in Antwerp. He enrolled again in an atelier, where he could draw and paint the nude from plaster casts and live models.Since he could ill afford to hire models, he painted large numbers of still-lifes of flowers in order to study the colour theory of Hals and Delacroix. He wrote that he was 'trying to render intense colour and not a grey harmony'. The present painting indicates to what extent he had accomplished this aim. It also demonstrates the now varied ways in which he applied his paint: dashes in the background to break up the blue field of the wall, directional brushstrokes on the table, impasto highlights on the metal vase. The plant itself is virtually drawn in colour; each leaf is a separate stroke and the heads of the flowers are depicted with more voluptuous and solid sweeps of paint	GOGH, Vincent van	Fritillaries in a Copper Vase	Oil on canvas, 74 x 61 cm	April-May 1887, Paris	still-life	Dutch	1851-1900

06439-12july.jpg	Neither the signature nor the date have survived on this panel, but it clearly belongs to the series of the Months, all the other panels of which are dated 1565. July and August are the months of the harvest, and this painting and the August panel (The Corn Harvest) show the bringing-in of the harvest. It is not just the grain that is being harvested but, as can be seen in the foreground, vegetables and berries as well. While each painting in the series shows the traditional occupation of that month, Bruegel's real subject is the landscape itself, its ever-changing appearance. There is a profound sense in which human activity is at best peripheral to the life of the landscape itself. Bruegel is concerned to show that the seasonal concerns of men are dictated by the land	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Haymaking (July)	Oil on panel, 117 x 161 cm	1565	landscape	Netherlandish	1501-1550

35367-05religi.jpg	The Oratorians commissioned a painting from Rubens for the high-altar of their main church, Santa Maria in Vallicella. Rubens painted the Ecstasy of St Gregory the Great, however, it was rejected on the ground that it reflected the light entering the church too strongly. For this reason the canvas was replaced by a new version on slate. This was quite different from the first painting; its composition was divided over three separate panels.

24460-crucifix.jpg	On February 19th 1426 Masaccio agreed to paint an altarpiece for a chapel in the church of the Carmine in Pisa for the sum of 80 florins. On December 26th of that year the work must have been already completed since payment for it is recorded on this date. Vasari gave a detailed description of the work which was the basis for art critics for the attempt at reconstruction and for the recovery and identification of the work which was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century. Only eleven pieces have so far come to light and they are not sufficient to enable a reliable reconstruction of the whole work. The Crucifixion is one of the eleven panels (one of the top panels) connected with the Pisa Polyptych.As in the main panel, the Gothic arch determines the pictorial frame, the upward stress of which Masaccio modifies in his composition. To counter the vertical trust imposed by the arch, Masaccio creates a strong horizontal effect with the rather exaggerated extension of the arms of Christ on the cross. Although Masaccio still uses the gilt background for his representation, the atmospheric effects remain hauntingly convincing.

37004-service.jpg	The Grote Kerk in Weesp was originally a Catholic church consecrated to St Lawrence, in 1582 it became Protestant and its name was changed from Laurentiuskerk to Grote Kerk.For Dutch architectural painters the people in the church served as staffage to enliven the stone setting. This is different with Sibilla: for him the architecture is not central, but rather the depicted persons, who are very large in relation to the building. About seventy can be counted, a few of whom seem to be portraits. Certain elements, such as the dogs, bring a genre scene to mind. The combination of a church interior, group portrait, and genre scene is unique in Sibilla's oeuvre	SIBILLA, Gijsbert Jansz.

10194-adamev05.jpg	To the rigorous, perfectly Renaissance Dürer, troubled by the question of the proportions of the human body, Cranach, in his nudes, responds by freeing himself from every rule and from any observation of anatomical accuracy. His figures are elongated out of all proportion, seem boneless and are shown in affected, theatrical poses. The naked bodies, ivory-coloured against a dark background, emanate a totally cold, intellectual eroticism. The effect is accentuated in this work, for example, by the malicious gesture with which Eve holds out the apple, with her other hand bent unnaturally to hold the frond which covers her loins, but above all by the sly expression on her slightly cruel face.Attributed once to Albrecht Dürer, the work is documented in Florentine Medicean collections yet in 1688	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Adam and Eve	Oil on wood, 172 x 63 cm and 167 x 61 cm	1528	religious	German	1501-1550
21646-rinaldo1.jpg	The subject was inspired by the 16th-century epic poem 'Gerusalemme Liberata' (Jerusalem Delivered) by Torquato Tasso (1544-1595). Rinaldo and Armida are a pair of lovers in the poem which is an idealized account of the first Crusade which ended with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the establishment of a Christian kingdom. Armida, a beautiful virgin witch, had been sent by Satan (whose aid the Saracens had enlisted0 to bring about the Crusaders' undoing by sorcery. She sought revenge on the Christian prince Rinaldo after he had rescued his companions whom she had changed into monsters. The pastoral story of hate turned of love, of the lovers' dalliance in Armida's magic kingdom, and Rinaldo's final desertion of her, forms a sequence of themes that were widely popular with Italian and French artists in the 17th and 18th centuries.

25100-2sebasti.jpg	St Sebastian is standing frontally with his hands over his head tied to a tree in a tree-filled landscape with abundant vegetation in the foreground. The towers of a castle loom up in the background. Apart from his loincloth he is naked. Both sides of his body are pierced with arrows. The handling of light is full of contrast, with ample use of white lead on the rosy skin standing out against the very dark green of the surroundings.Various characteristics in the manner of painting and the style, as well as the conception, enable us to ascribe this hitherto unknown panel to the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. The stiff, marionette-like figures with heavily drawn features; the hard, richly contrasted palette; and the systematic use in his landscapes of stereotypical vegetation and towers or city views in the distance are typical of nearly all his compositions.In this St Sebastian all these elements are clearly visible. The physiognomy with the heavy nose and the rather oriental eyes with large, vaulted upper eyelids and bushy eyebrows is to be seen in several of his works, for example, the Lamentation in Minneapolis and in the Tallinn altarpiece. The flat folds of the loincloth can be compared with the Virgin's head-scarf in the Lamentation of the Thyssen Foundation, where Christ's torso has been modelled in much the same way. The manner in which the vegetation is treated is almost identical in the St John on Patmos of Rotterdam and in the Legend of St Lucy in St James' Church in Bruges.Owing to its small format, it can be suspected that the St Sebastian was the wing of a triptych. The painting on the reverse was probably planed away when the cradle was applied	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Lucy	St Sebastian	Oil on oak panel, 70 x 27 cm	1480-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
05199-11magici.jpg	The Magician belonging to Bosch's early paintings is now lost but it is known through a faithful copy at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. A mountebank has set up his table before a crumbling stone wall. His audience watches spellbound as he seems to bring forth a frog from the mouth of an old man in their midst; only one of the crowd, the young man with his hand on the shoulder of his female companion, appears to notice that the old man's purse is being stolen by the conjuror's confederate. The myopic gaze of the thief and the stupid amazement of the frog-spitting victim are superbly played off against the amused reactions of the bystanders, while the slyness of the mountebank is well conveyed in his sharp-nosed physiognomy. Bosch exploits the human face in profile for expressive purposes. Although the painting may possess a moralizing significance, it must have been inspired by a real-life situation closely observed. The perceptive, spontaneous humour of this little picture would be difficult to match in contemporary Flemish painting, but parallels can be found among Dutch manuscript illuminators	BOSCH, Hieronymus	The Magician	Oil on panel, 53 x 75 cm	1475-80	genre	Netherlandish	1451-1500

07957-farnes01.jpg	In 1597 Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Annibale Carracci's great masterpiece, the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese in the Palazzo Farnese, the most splendid and influential ceiling decoration in Rome since that of the Sistine Chapel. Annibale's brother Agostino assisted him on at least two of the scenes until they quarrelled and Agostino left Rome. In contrast to the earlier interpretation which saw them as a Neoplatonic allegory of the victory of Celestial Love over physical passion, in recent years Annibale's frescoes have generally been regarded as a witty and joyous celebration of the classical gods in love.During the 1570s and 1580s fresco cycles with mythological subjects had been relatively unfashionable in Rome, since the climate of the Counter Reformation favoured religious decoration, even in secular buildings such as palaces and villas. It may be a measure of the Catholic Church's confidence in winning the battle for souls that it could increasingly tolerate such overtly erotic decoration, even in a cardinal's palace, albeit in what was probably one of the more private rooms. Besides celebrating love's power to conquer, it is likely that the frescoes were intended to complement the antique statues, some of the finest in one of Rome's most magnificent collection of antiquities, which were displayed there	CARRACCI, Annibale	The Galleria Farnese	Fresco	1597-1602	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
37208-maesta_2.jpg	After a few years of Duccio's Maest&#224;, Simone painted his Maest&#224; for the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, as the ideal of the good and just government. This is the oldest painting that can be safely attributed to him. The end wall of the Sala del Mappamondo is entirely covered by this fresco. Surrounded by a frame decorated with twenty medallions depicting the Blessing Christ, the Prophets and the Evangelists and with smaller shields containing the coat-of-arms of Siena, the fresco shows a host of angels, Saints and Apostles, with the Madonna and Child in the centre. The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk.The most obvious innovations present in Simone's style are his ideas of three-dimensional space. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition. Under the canopy there is a crowd of thirty people: no more processions of people in parallel rows, but concrete spacial rhythms and animated gestures	SIMONE MARTINI	Maest?

00123-marketse.jpg	The painting is an Ecce Homo fragment. Similarly to other biblical paintings of Aertsen, the biblical event takes place at the back, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene.. Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6). This is optically overlaid by the bow-shaped arrangement of carts and market stalls - a reversal of emphasis which is typical of Aertsen	AERTSEN, Pieter	Market Scene	Oil on oak, 59,5 x 122,5 cm	c. 1550	still-life	Netherlandish	1501-1550

19512-luke_pai.jpg	Due to the fame of Rogier van der Weyden's St Luke Painting the Virgin, dozens of artists painted this subject over the next century, especially in the Low Countries and Germany. The composition and its content evolved over time as attitudes about art changed. Van Heemskerk created his version possibly as an altarpiece for Delft's St Luke's guild. The apparent influence of Michelangelo and the inclusion of antique sculptures indicates the stay of the artist in Rome. The painting harks back to Jan Gossart's St Luke Painting the Virgin in Prague, but now the background reflects his visits to courtyards in Rome that were full of recently unearthed antiquities	HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van	St Luke Painting the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 206 x 144 cm	1550-53	religious	Dutch	1501-1550
12980-grimaldi.jpg	The Genoese noblewoman is shown on the terrace of her palace. The soaring columns and cloud-swept sky add a sense of height and dignity to the majestic figure, while the brilliant red parasol relieves the otherwise somber colour scheme. The Genoese nobility, wealthy from the trade of its powerful merchant marine, had many ties with members of the Spanish court and adopted many customs from them, including the sumptuous but sober fabrics of courtly dress. Van Dyck, in these portraits of his Genoese period, has immortalized the dignity and splendid scale of living of his patrons	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Marchesa Elena Grimaldi Cattaneo	Oil on canvas, 243 x 139 cm	c. 1623	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
10300-06woman4.jpg	Margaret of Austria was one of the most significant female figures of the sixteenth century, and won the respect of his contemporaries by the conduct of her life and office (as the Governess-General and regent of the Netherlands.

Cranach's painting is based on van Orley, his source was, however, not one of the official portraits but a chalk drawing now in Berlin.The painter depicts the sitter in a white hood in the Netherlandish style. The Governess of the Netherlands had adopted this form of dress in a modest acknowledgement of her widowhood	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Portrait of Margaret of Austria	Oil and tempera on red beechwood, 50 x 35 cm	1520s	portrait	German	1501-1550
40998-08virdol.jpg	"On grounds of the inscription on the cover of the twelve panels that had originally been fastened together to form a book, the picture is considered to be the work of a painter called ""Jaques Daliwe"", who probably had immigrated to France from the Low Countries and then worked beside the Limbourg brothers in the court of the Duc de Berry. (Though the name ""Daliwe"" could be also a reference to the proprietor.) The artist may have used the booklet as a note-book for about twenty years. In it he put down his memories, ideas and everything he saw and considered interesting while moving from one place to another. Often, as was the case with the drawing reproduced here, he composed homogeneous scenes from the different motifs in his individual manner.As a rule the seated lamenting figures of the Virgin and St John are represented below the crucified Christ. But here both Christ and the cross have been removed and only the two of them remain in the place of the Crucifixion. In front of them there are scattered the instruments of torture, whereas behind them - as though it were their common thought - the figure of the suffering Christ is to be seen surrounded by a cloud of angels. His face is distorted by pain, His head is bowed forwards and His crossed arms have slipped slightly sideways in the sarcophagus. The imagination of His mother and His favourite disciple have enlarged His figure into monumental dimensions, but the two react to the scene in different ways: the Virgin is leaning her face onto her hand and is engrossed in her thoughts; wrapped in her cloak, she stares into space. St John is more agitated and active, and raises his head passionately.The difference between the vision and the real scene is shown not only in the scale of the figures but also in the technique of drawing. The Virgin, St John and the ground are modelled with the most delicate tints of grey, while the paler figure of Christ is interpreted by more linear means, first of all with contours, whereas the host of angels is conveyed only by gossamer fine outlines. The drawing may have been a preparatory sketch to a painting, its composition being based on a strictly geometrical framework. The central axis of the picture is indicated by two nails lying in the foreground and meeting at their tips. If we, in our imagination, lengthen their lines up to the top corners we get two smaller triangles on the two sides and a larger one in the middle of the top. The former include the figures of the Virgin and of St John respectively, whereas the latter frames Christ's figure with the angels, whose whirling movements fill up the triangle standing on its point"	UNKNOWN MASTER, French	Vir Dolorum (Man of Sorrows)	Lead and tempera on wood, 8,7 x 12,6 cm	1400-20	religious	French	1401-1450

22605-9annunci.jpg	This  is an early version of the theme of Annunciation which Fra Filippo Lippi treated several times during his career. Lippi shows the figures caught in a diagonal shaft of light that falls across the back of the angel and illuminates the Virgin by passing through an open door notionally located behind a pilaster with engaged columns. The bilateral division of the Annunciation by a prominent architectural feature is a hallmark of Lippi's early work	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	The Annunciation	Tempera on panel, 100 x 161 cm	1435-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450
41312-01madonn.jpg	"Originally venerated in the convent church of Santa Maria in Campo Marzio (Rome) this painting is an icon: its miraculous powers are attested by Bombelli, in his 1792 engraving of the panel. Iconographically, the image is connected to the Constantinopolitan ""Haghiosoritissa"", a type of image in which the Virgin is represented in the act of interceding with Christ on behalf of the human race. The proposed dating of the painting to the middle of the twelfth century is generally accepted on the basis of stylistic similarities to a panel of the Last Judgment in the Pinacoteca of the Vatican Museums.Stylistically different from other Roman panels that depict the same subject, the painting has been assigned to the same hand that executed the Blessing Christ (Vatican Museums, Pinacoteca), a picture that also originally decorated Santa Maria in Campo Marzio. The two works are characterized by an accentuated linearism typical of Byzantine style and a monumental quality that is distinctly Roman. They show identical treatments of chiaroscuro effects, simplified folds of the drapery, and effects light. Also shared by the two paintings are the brown intonations in the face, which give little concession to colorism, and certain signature characteristics like the rapid brushwork with which the artist defines the folds of Christ's neck or the dark triangle that divides the eyebrows of the Virgin.The inscription at the bottom: ""SCA VIRGO VIRGINUM"""	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	The Madonna as Advocate (Haghiosoritissa)	Tempera on panel covered with canvas, 107 x 58 cm	1150s	religious	Italian	1151-1200

Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife. However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned. It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses	HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder	Portrait of a Man	Oil on panel, 24 x 17 cm	1518-20	portrait	German	1451-1500

It is probably by a copyist.The bearded sitter in this portrait rests his arms on a stone parapet and holds a rosary with a pomander attached. He wears a broad-rimmed hat over a gold cap, a fur coat over a black shirt and white undershirt, and a gold ring on the left index finger.

00960-03prede3.jpg	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes	ANGELICO, Fra	The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in Heaven	Tempera and gold on panel, 26 x 53 cm	1434-35	religious	Italian	1401-1450

40733-01icon.jpg	The centre of the high altar in the Santa Maria della Salute holds the icon of the Madonna of Health, installed here in November 1670. It came from Candia cathedral where it was known as the San Tito Madonna or Mesopanditissa (after the day on which it was celebrated, between Christmas and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). Doge Morosini brought it to Venice as a trophy after peace had been made with the Turks at the end of the Candia war. Tradition has it that the artist was St Luke the Evangelist and that it is consequently a miraculous sacred image, but it was actually the work of a 12th century Madonna painter.

26346-composin.jpg	The emphasis on gentility and opulence intensified in Metsu's works during the final years  of his career as did his painstaking technique which became harder and drier. Such works as the Young Woman Composing Music present a rarefied view of the leisure life of moneyed urbanites. In this panel, a woman gazes serenely as if lost in thought as she composes music, poised to record the notes played by her lute-strumming confidant behind the table. A man, perhaps an admirer, peers over her shoulder as she works. The room is extravagantly decorated from its wooden table bedecked with an expensive Turkish carpet to the eye-catching mantelpiece that mimics a real one in the Amsterdam Town Hall.

07410-pepoli2.jpg	From a young age, the painter enjoyed the protection of the Pepoli family. Count Odoardo Pepoli commissioned Canuti to paint two long oval ceiling pictures in the stairwell of the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande. They illustrated significant events from the life of Taddeo Pepoli. Canuti here shows himself to have been a close student of Veronese, from whom, in addition to the oval shape and certain compositional elements, he adopted the extreme view from below	CANUTI, Domenico Maria	Taddeo Pepoli Installed as Apostolic Vicar by Pope Benedict XII	Fresco	1655	mythological	Italian	1651-1700
25926-cremona1.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the façade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the façade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515. Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative. The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.Melone continued the cycle on the right wall, he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists	MELONE, Altobello	Flight to Egypt	Fresco	1517	religious	Italian	1501-1550
22214-lot_daug.jpg	"The story of the destruction of Sodom, Lot's escape, and his subsequent seduction by his two daughters is told in Genesis. Lot and his family were allowed to leave the city on condition that they did not look back. Lot's wife disobeyed the instruction and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot continued on with his daughters. Since their husbands had not fled with them, the daughters said to each other: ""Our father is old and there is not a man in the country to come to us in the usual way. Come now, let us make our father drink wine and then lie with him and in this way keep the family alive through our father."" The sons born of this union subsequently founded the tribes of the Moabites and the Ammonites.Both as a strongly erotic group painting and as a history painting, the subject was a popular one in the 16th and 17th century. This painting, whose attribution to van Leyden - said to have executed his first commission at the age of twelve - is not altogether certain, falls into the second category. Alongside the group in the foreground, the destruction of Sodom seen in the left-hand background establishes a second point of focus. Influenced by Patenier, the painter portrays a kind of ""global landscape"" extending from the front left-hand corner into the depths of the composition. He thereby devotes particular care to the execution of the landscape details"	LEYDEN, Lucas van	Lot and his Daughters	Oil on wood, 48 x 34 cm	c. 1520	religious	Netherlandish	1501-1550

12020-witchcra.jpg	The official painter of the Este court, Dossi painted the family portraits, filled castles with paintings and frescoed villas. This routine, which for other painters might have seemed mortifying, did nothing to extinguish the vivacious and brilliant vein of the artist. Dossi is always consistent. He flushes the flesh tones of his characters with orangy, reddish colours, he places them in risqué situations, with bare-chested women in convivial surroundings and almost obscene merrymaking men with such highly characterized faces that they are almost caricatures. The faces of the women and that of the faun are drawn directly from a cultured classical tradition which is inserted into the Mannerist context. The other characters, emerging from a humid, obscure background, are anything but stereotypes: healthy faces reddened by feasting, grimaces, a variety of attitudes. The only note of light - quite unreal - which stands out from the prevalently ruddy tones, falls directly onto the breasts of the woman holding a bowl of fruit	DOSSI, Dosso	Witchcraft (Allegory of Hercules)	Oil on canvas, 143 x 144 cm	1540-42	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

40185-allegory.jpg	In his large-scale pictures, De Troy tends to lose vivacity of touch, replacing it by a rather heavy handling which can yet be effective, though it probably accounted partly for the unenthusiastic reception his actual cartoons, for example, had in Paris. His imagination was rather heavy, too. The result could be a curious blend of the prosaic and the painterly, as instanced in the Allegory of Time unveiling Truth. There is something ludicrous about Time's would-be flying figure, suspended so awkwardly and with his legs oddly detached. Altogether, as allegory, the composition remains prosaically earthbound	TROY, Jean-François de	An Allegory of Time Unveiling Truth	Oil on canvas	1733	mythological	French	1701-1750

07186-canal303.jpg	The compositions of this work and its companion picture (The Molo: Looking West, in the same collection) complement each other very effectively; they both show dominant buildings in the foreground to one side of the picture, from which the eye meanders both across the painting and into the distance. Their subjects are also complementary; they depict views of the waterfront on either side of the Molo, the seaward part of the Piazzetta. In this painting the view extends from the Doge's Palace right along the quay known as the Riva degli Schiavoni. Boats of all sizes throng the water, and Venetians are shown either in the lofty pursuit of trade and politics (a group of officials energe from the Doge's Palace), or the equally fascinating, although more down to earth business of begging and gossiping. The other painting shows the view from the Column of San Teodoro over towards Santa Maria della Salute on the far side of the Grand Canal.These subjects became extremely popular and were rethought by Canaletto and his studio with small variations for a number of other clients. Canaletto executed related drawings which both he and his assistants could use as a guide when plotting these views	CANALETTO	Riva degli Schiavoni: Looking East	Oil on canvas, 58,4 x 101,6 cm	1730	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

19587-stjerome.jpg	Jan Sanders van Hemessen's religious works are dominated by genre elements. His work therefore represents a significant step in the development of genre painting in its own right. St. Jerome, which originally hung in Rockox's house, is an early work and not entirely typical. In it, he does move away from the traditional rules which artists followed meekly enough in the previous century, and appears to be searching for some kind of originality through exaggeration and ostentation, both in the external appearance of the figure he depicts, and in the emotions he sought to convey	HEMESSEN, Jan Sanders van	St Jerome	Oil on panel, 103 x 81 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
08439-pillow.jpg	"The painting depicts a group of young women in full length, modestly dressed and seated on simple wicker chairs, who are making pillow lace in a bare room without windows or furnishings. The ""sewing school,"" a widespread theme in genre painting of the period, was most likely developed as such by the Danish artist Bernhard Keil (1624-1687), known as Mons&#249; Bernardo, who was active in northern Italy and who repeatedly treated the subject as an allegory of the senses of touch and sight"	CERUTI, Giacomo	Women Working on Pillow Lace (The Sewing School)	Oil on canvas, 150 x 200 cm	1720s	genre	Italian	1701-1750
31008-shepher.jpg	The companion piece depicting a Shepherd Boy is also in the Residenzgalerie in Salzburg.Piazzetta's unusual way of depicting the Peasant Girl and the Shepherd Boy is evidenced first of all by his choice of a transverse oval picture format. Only a partial view of the boy is given, and his face, which is aligned slightly rearwards, is partly covered by a large hat. In his frontal view of the sleeping girl, the artist underlined the intimate, lascivious character of the picture by giving her a low-cut dress.The half-length paintings of the girl and boy are modelled on the half-length figures of Caravaggio. The artist was indebted to Crespi for the genre elements and the down-to-earth realism of the depictions as well as for its traditional rustic character	PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista	Peasant Girl	Oil on canvas, 66 x 83 cm	1720-22	genre	Italian	1701-1750
43135-abraham.jpg	For long time it was thought that the painting represents Jacob and Laban.

09663-1stufa1.jpg	"The picture shows a view of the Stanza della Stufa with the Age of Iron (left) and the Age of Gold and Age of Silver (right).Of the numerous apartments in the Palazzo Pitti, two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.In the winter quarters Pietro da Cortona decorated the Stanza della Stufa, and the Rooms of the Planets (Sala di Venere; Sala di Giove; Sala di Marte; Sala di Apollo) between 1637 and 1661.The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641.

28657-5cathed2.jpg	When Monet began his serial compositions in the late 1880s, which initially featured haystacks, then polars, and in the early 1890s the cathedral at Rouen, these works constituted a logical progression of his artistic interests. By constantly portraying the same subject, the variables determined by the time of the day and the lighting could be particularly strongly accentuated. Different times of day and a changing colour palette were substituted for innovative subject matter. Monet included the time of the day and the dominant colours in the respective titles of his paintings as a matter of course.Sometimes he worked simultaneously on two canvases, in order to be able to react immediately to changing light conditions. As a result, the subject of the picture receded further and further into the background. At first glance we can see the shape of a cathedral, but on closer inspection the cathedral architecture dissolves before our eyes into a vibrant ensemble, composed merely of a collection of brush strokes	MONET, Claude	Rouen Cathedral in Full Sunlight	Oil on canvas, 107 x 73 cm	1893	landscape	French	1851-1900

To the right, behind Old Horse Guards on the far side of Whitehall, is Inigo Jones' Banqueting Hall.

17142-arles64.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 604, JH 1656.This cheerful still-life was painted shortly after van Gogh left the hospital in Arles which he had entered after his first major attack of psychomotor epilepsy on 25 December 1888. The objects depicted have both an allegorical and a more personal significance. The lighted candle, used in the painting of Gauguin's chair, derives from the emblematic tradition of still-life and signifies light and life; its opposite, the snuffed-out candle, was used in memento mori still-life and van Gogh had included it in a still-life with books which he painted after his father's death in 1885 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh). The optimistic note sounded by the candle flame is underlined by the presence of the sprouting onions, taken from his Yellow Chair (a 'self-portrait'). On the other hand, van Gogh has added his pipe and tobacco and an empty bottle, possibly once containing absinthe, all of which endangered his health.Modern research has intriguingly shown that absinthe itself can cause epileptic fits. Van Gogh had consumed this poisonous beverage in some quantity during the months in Arles, and many of his subsequent fits coincide with occasions on which he had access to it. The drawing board on which most of these objects are placed indicates van Gogh's resumption of work. He informed his brother that he was painting still-lifes to ease himself back into painting after his hospitalization. However, the colours used in this painting are more tempered and less intense, more controlled and less arbitrary than those he had been using both in the summer of 1888 and under the aegis of Gauguin in the autumn preceding his attack	GOGH, Vincent van	Still-Life with Drawing Board and Onions	Oil on canvas, 50 x 64 cm	January 1889, Arles	still-life	Dutch	1851-1900

34360-s_marco.jpg	The painting shows the profile of Venice as it appears from the present-day Giardini when approaching the city by boat from the Lido. To the far left is the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, with the church of the same name and the complex of the Benedictine monastery. Just to the right of the island appear the Magazzini del Sal, dazzlingly illuminated, the Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute on the spit of land known as the Dorsoduro. The Campanile of San Marco looms right on the vertical axis, counterbalancing the predominant horizontals. On the right, the Riva degli Schiavoni stretches beyond the church of the Pieta.The glassy green surface of the water with the dark bank in the foreground, the contrasting light on the various buildings and the snow-white clouds lend the painting an atmosphere all its own. The boat and the shadows in the foreground are motifs which also occur in works of late seventeenth-century Dutch painters of harbour views such as Abraham and Johannes Storck, who may have served Richter as a source of inspiration.Typical of Richter's work are the boats in the foreground painted horizontal to the picture plane. The present canvas occupies a special position among Richter's identified works. He usually worked in the style of Carlevaris, whom he imitated deceptively well. However, in this picture Canaletto's spacious views of the Lagoon were his principal source of inspiration. The remarkable colour combination &#151; green and black &#151; recalls Canaletto's work of the early 1730s.

She is surrounded by St Peter with the keys and a book, St Catherine with a broken wheel, St Margaret with a cross, and St Paul with a sword and book. In order to create the impression of a real altarpiece, several angels are holding a curtain around the altar painting. At the bottom edge of the picture, as if placed there quite by chance, Benozzo has painted a small pointed panel painting showing the face of Christ	GOZZOLI, Benozzo	Maria Lactans	Transferred fresco	1484	religious	Italian	1451-1500
38854-bologna1.jpg	The young Pellegrino Tibaldi, who was one of Daniele da Volterra's assistants in Rome, executed two murals in the newly constructed chapel of Cardinal Giovanni Poggi in San Giacomo, Bologna. The chapel, which is dedicated to John the Baptist, has an elaborate system of architectonic articulation. Tibaldi's frescoes (The Sermon of John the Baptist; Annunciation of the Birth of John the Baptist) are restricted to one large field each on the left and right walls. The frescoes are distinguished by unconventional iconography, learned allegory, and newly invented moments in history, that are at the same time commented on by painted manifestations in the heavens.In the left-hand mural John is baptizing and preaching repentance, while angels in heaven are putting devils into chains	TIBALDI, Pellegrino	The Sermon of John the Baptist	Fresco	1551-53	religious	Italian	1551-1600
11485-portlord.jpg	This painting represents a small full-length portrait of Lord Robert Kerr standing by a tree; a military camp beyond. Lord Robert Kerr was a cornet in Lord Mark Kerr's Regiment of Dragoons where he had been commissioned in 1739.Arthur Devis is the best of the many English 18th-century painters of small-scale intimate portraits and conversation pieces.

Wee seem to be looking through the arches of a gigantic loggia into scenes from Enea Silvio's life. The pageant-like incidents display a panoply of colourful costumes against fanciful architectural or landscape backgrounds, except when a recognizable setting was required by the narrative	PINTURICCHIO	View of the Piccolomini Library	Fresco	1502-08	interior	Italian	1451-1500

43874-haarlem.jpg	For Weissenbruch and other artists of the Hague School, with their knowledge of Dutch 17th-century art and the Barbizon School, plain air painting became fundamental. Taking Daubigny's floating studio as their model, Weissenbruch and Roelofs regularly went out in boats. Weissenbruch's spacious Dutch scenes, such as View of Haarlem, contrast in their use of bolder and broader brushwork. In their own specific lyrical way, drawing foremost on the colourist juxtaposition of silvery blues and greens with warmer shades, Weissenbruch paintings nicely captured the moist atmosphere that lies upon Dutch landscapes	WEISSENBRUCH, Jan Hendrik	View of Haarlem	Oil on canvas, 72 x 102 cm	-	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
14381-lastjudg.jpg	The Last Judgment by Hieronymus Francken II is the companion piece of the Damned Being Cast into Hell by Frans Francken II. Frans II and Hieronymus II were brothers, they were taught by their uncle Hieronymus I at the same time. This explains the similarity of their hand. Both scenes were based on engravings from a cycle by Hendrik Goltzius.In the Last Judgment most of the figures were taken from Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican	FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, II	The Last Judgment	Oil on oak, 47 x 32 cm	1605-10	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
35516-48mythol.jpg	"The source of the subject is Ovid's Metamorphoses.The love affairs of gods never bode well for mortals; there were times when they caused nothing but suffering even for some of the nymphs. Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard. The inventive god (the Greeks called him ""Hermes dolios"", the schemer) approached the meadows, herding some goats which he had stolen along the way, and played songs on his pipe. The guard was charmed by the new and masterful melodies.Mercury watches intently as Argus is mesmerized by the sound of the flute, and he is already reaching for the weapon with which he will behead the sleepy guardian.Rubens depicted a fipple flute in place of a Pan-pipe. From the aulos used at feasts of Antiquity and the Roman tibia through the medieval bagpipes and Renaissance-Baroque horns and musettes, all the way to the saxophone of our times, every wind instrument was attributed with having a dangerous mesmerizing power"	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Mercury and Argus	Oil on panel, 63 x 87,5 cm	1635-38	mythological	Flemish	1601-1650
29968-winter_n.jpg	The painting depicts a winter landscape with figures on a frozen river, a town beyond. Highlighted near the centre, a group of figures stand in conversation, amongst whom a white horse - a recurring motif in Isaac van Ostade's work - stands with its head bowed.The theme of crowded winter landscapes, pioneered by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, became extremely popular in the seventeenth century. It was one of van Ostade's favourite subjects, and he became one of the genre's finest exponents	OSTADE, Isaack van	Winter Landscape	Oil on panel, 51 x 77 cm	-	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
36455-adoratio.jpg	This is a fine example of Savoldo's mature work. He painted various versions of the same ever-popular subject, but the Brescia painting is the most concentrated and convincing. It reveals Savoldo's appealing poetic sentiment which is demonstrated through the simple and direct gestures of the characters, fully expressing their humanity. The light is subtle and the details build up an impressive feeling of realism. Savoldo's true forte was for night scenes like this, which let him give his liking for unusual light effects full play. Particularly noteworthy is the contrast of the dark background and the brilliantly yet softly illuminated figures in the foreground	SAVOLDO, Giovanni Girolamo	Adoration of the Shepherds	Wood	c. 1540	religious	Italian	1501-1550

37681-luteplay.jpg	The Lute Player exemplifies Sorgh's approach to fashionable imagery in his later years. He depicts a young dandy with a double-necked lute serenading the unimpressed recipient of his affections in a gated veranda before an urban setting. The painting is obviously replete with references to love and courtship. Playing musical instruments was long considered indispensable to fostering Eros and in this sense, Sorgh's foppish, lute player is entirely conventional.	SORGH, Hendrick Maertensz.

25224-karlstei.jpg	Master Theoderic, a highly original artist, broke free of the styles that were dominated by Italian, Austrian and French art and tried to develop his own distinctive style. Painted between 1360 and 1365, the 30 icon-like portraits of the saints which decorate the Chapel of the Cross at Karlstein Castle are one of the most impressive results of these efforts. The robust features of the individual saints are impressively depicted.Three-dimensional objects have been added, such as carved coats-of-arms, mounted in the manner of collages on the surface of the paintings. Ornamented with discs of gilded Venetian glass and strips of marble encrusted with semiprecious stones, the chapel seems like a Byzantine treasure chamber. It is possible that this room and the adjacent 'privatorium' were intended by the Emperor to create a vision of his future Eastern empire	MASTER THEODERIC	Paintings of Saints	Tempera on wood	1360-65	religious	Bohemian	1351-1400

06109-fugger_c.jpg	"It is presumed that Sebastian Loscher and Hans Burgkmair were jointly responsible for the plans for the Fugger Chapel. The architecture of this family vault for Jakob, Ulrich, and Georg Fugger, which was consecrated in 1518, introduced the vocabulary of the early Italian Renaissance to Germany for the first time. The contemporary furnishings, with sculptures by the Daucher workshop and the painted organ shutters by Jörg Breu the Elder, are important works of the Renaissance, which reached the north of Europe in the early 16th century.The Fuggers were a Swabian merchant and banking family who were also major patrons of the arts, established in Augsburg from 1367. The founder of the Fugger trading house was Jacob I (d. 1469), but the fame and wealth of the family was due to his sons Ulrich (1441-1510), Georg (1453-1506), and Jakob II (""the Rich,"" 1459-1525), founder of the Fugger Chapel in St. Anna's church in Augsburg.

00781-3predel4.jpg	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. In this scene Joseph, the Virgin, the High Priest and St Anne stand in the foreground, a nave of receding columns extending backwards behind them.

25901-port_art.jpg	Luis Meléndez trained under his father Francisco Antonio Meléndez (1682-1752), a specialist royal portrait miniaturist, who was instrumental in the encouragement of Philip V to establish an academy of fine arts in Madrid, which he eventually founded in 1744, making the artist an honorary director of painting. Luis Meléndez was one of the first students admitted into the new academy (which was later named the Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1753), where he rapidly excelled in the art of drawing, an event celebrated in his handsome self-portrait (and remarkably the only known portrait by Meléndez) of 1746, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. The highly accomplished skill displayed in this portrait reflects the experience gained by the artist during his apprenticeship to the royal portrait painter Louis-Michel van Loo from 1738 until 1744.

Plump and self-confident, the Bergamasque noblewoman stands out with vibrating luminosity against the dark background. In this portrait Lotto mixes various features, namely the sense of belonging to the peaceful life of Bergamo, the ability to depict the sitters extremely vividly and the fondness for plays on words. In fact, the lady's name is concealed in a rebus: in the moon (luna in Italian) on the left the letters CI appear, thus form Lu-ci-na	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Portrait of Lucina Brembati	Oil on panel, 53 x 45 cm	c. 1518	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

The delicately rendered strands of his graying hair and the salt-and-pepper stubble of his beard, as well as his deeply lined jowls, sagging double chin, and the crow's-feet at the edge of his left eye, are closely observed.This painting was once attributed to Hans Holbein. However, the style and execution are typical of Gossart's, rather than Holbein's works. Such portraits of modest size, tightly cropped, and featuring a plain dark green background were parrt of Gossart's standard output	GOSSART, Jan	Portrait of a Man	Oil on oak panel, 34 x 24 cm	1525-30	portrait	Flemish	1501-1550
30134-company.jpg	This painting depicts a gathering of thirteen expensively dressed young men and women who are enjoying the pleasure of eating, drinking, smoking, and making music in each other's company. As is often the case in Palamedesz's interiors, a group of people is crowded into the right half of the picture, leaving the space at the left almost empty. This imbalance is compensated by placing in the empty corner the figure of the servant boy dressed in red and pouring wine for the merrymakers.This painting is strongly reminiscent of works with similar subject matter by artists active in northern Holland, such as Dirck Hals, Pieter Codde, Willem Duyster, and Hendrick Pot	PALAMEDESZ., Anthonie	Company Dining and Making Music	Oil on panel, 47 x 73 cm	1632	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
44073-3froimo2.jpg	The name of the subject of the portrait was deduced from the grisaille on the reverse side of the panel. The patterned background resembling a hanging is different from the usual neutral backgrounds of Rogier's portraits. In addition, the donor's face seems more softly but less artistically modeled than in those portraits. Since dendrochronology suggests the date of 1469 for the panel showing the donor, the diptych may have been painted by the workshop after Rogier's death	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (right wing)	Oil on oak panel, 49,3 x 31,5 cm	1460s	portrait	Flemish	1401-1450
13414-21paele.jpg	"Here the visual and thematic elements are similar to those of the Chancellor Rolin Madonna. Van Eyck is concerned with showing the presence of a vision and therefore of illustrating the reality of God in our world. Just as Nicolas Rolin is shown in his palace, in the midst of an identifiable environment that seems to make his vision of the Virgin all the more real, so Canon van der Paele is shown in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Donatian in Bruges, where he is being presented to the Virgin by St. George and St. Donatian. Hans Belting is of the opinion that this picture once hung in the choir of the now destroyed church. This would mean that the depicted location mirrored the real location. Van der Paele would therefore have been able to see himself in the very place of his depicted vision and so ""prove"" to the world at large the reality of his divine experience.The exquisite brocades, furs, and silks are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility. On the other hand, the reliefs and sculptures on the capitals in the background and on the Virgin's throne all allude to Christ's salvation of humanity. The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world. Redemption from sin (Cain killing his brother) is possible only through the power of faith (Samson overpowering the lion). The goodness and grace of God ""at the moment of truth"" (Abraham sacrificing Isaac) serves as proof of the redeeming power and presence of servants of God both celestial (St. George) and mortal (Canon van der Paele).This is how van der Paele might have expressed the message of the painting-that paradise was at hand-a message confirmed by its being set in a very real but also sacred context. The Virgin is pictures holding a nosegay and her son a parrot - unmistakable echoes of the Garden of Eden - and both figures have turned to face the meditating canon"	EYCK, Jan van	The Madonna with Canon van der Paele	Oil on wood, 122 x 157 cm	1436	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

23057-40nichol.jpg	The panel (and another also in the Uffizi) came from the church of St Procolo in Florence where it was recorded by Vasari. Presumably it was painted as side wing of a triptych which had a figure of St Nicholas in the central panel (which has disappeared) during the second visit of Ambrogio to Florence between 1327 and 1332, or later. Another possibility is that the panels made up a tabernacle door.The upper scene represents the resurrection of the dead child.

14084-chevalie.jpg	This is the leftt wing of a diptych, originally located in Melun. The right wing showing the Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels is in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp.Estienne Chevalier, who came from Melun, was French Ambassador to England in 1445 and six years later became Treasurer to Charles VII of France. He presented the diptych of which this panel forms the left wing, to his native town; on this wing he had himself painted next to his patron saint, Stephen. The saint, wearing a deacon's robe, is holding a book, on which a jagged stone is lying, as a symbol of his martyrdom. The formal architecture in the background is in the Italian Renaissance style showing pilasters with coloured inlaid marble panels between them. On the wall, receding in perspective, the name Estienne Chevalier is inscribed several times. Originally the donor and the saint were looking towards the Madonna, who occupied the right wing of the diptych; this panel found its way into the Antwerp Museum.According to a description of the paintings by Denis Godefroy in 1661, the original frames were covered in blue velvet. Round each picture were strands of gold and silver thread, in which the donor's initials were woven in pearls. There were also gilded medallions on which stories of the saints were represented.Tradition has it - and there is considerable supporting evidence - that the Madonna's features are those of Agnes Sorel, the beautiful and influential mistress of Charles VII. Known portraits of her certainly do not conflict with this hypothesis. Her relationship with Estienne Chevalier was not entirely political, and an eighteenth-century inscription on the back of the Antwerp panel tells us that the diptych of Melun was endowed by Estienne following a vow he made on her death in 1450. The diptych was in the chancel of the Church of Notre-Dame at Melun, south of Paris, from 1461 until about 1775, when the two halves became separated.The date of Agnes Sorel's death is not the only reason for assuming that the diptych was painted around 1450. At any later period the cut of Estienne's robe would no longer have been in fashion. A few years earlier, between 1443 and 1447, Fouquet had been in Italy and the background of the Berlin panel is clearly the result of what he saw there. After returning from the south, he settled in his birthplace, Tours. From then on he worked for Charles VII and the court and became the leading exponent of the French Court style	FOUQUET, Jean	Melun Diptych: Estienne Chevalier with St Stephen	Wood, 93 x 85 cm	c. 1450	portrait	French	1451-1500

32309-07moses.jpg	This painting, the latest and grandest of Poussin's three versions of the theme, was acquired by the National Gallery jointly with the National Museum of Wales in 1988 and is shown alternately in London and Cardiff. Poussin illustrated events from the life of Moses at least nineteen times. It has been pointed out that when he could, he avoided painting scenes of saintly visions or martyrdoms, the stock-in-trade of seventeenth-century religious art. He concentrated instead on the central themes of Christianity, relating them both to their historical context in the ancient Near East and to the basic tenets of other religions, following an intellectual fashion of the day. Of the Old Testament subjects which he painted, the majority belong to the category of types, or prefigurations, of Salvation.From Early Christian times the Old Testament was read by Christians for its analogies with the New. Thus the waters of the Nile to which the infant Moses is consigned by his mother in 'an ark of bulrushes', following Pharaoh's cruel order to drown all the male Israelite babies (Exodus 1:2), were likened to the waters of baptism. But Poussin's interest in Moses may have been prompted also by his identification with pagan deities; as a contemporary writer influenced by these ideas wrote of this picture: 'He is Moses, the Mosche of the Hebrews, the Pan of the Arcadians, the Priapus of the Hellespont, the Anubis of the Egyptians.'All these ideas reverberate throughout the painting. The baby on whom Pharaoh's daughter has taken pity resembles the Christ Child blessing the Magi or the shepherds in a scene of the Adoration. In the background on the left an Egyptian priest worships the dog-shaped god Anubis (barely visible now that the surface paint has grown thin and transparent). We know we are in Egypt because on the rock above the main scene a river god, symbolising the Nile, embraces a sphinx, palm trees stand on the shore and an obelisk rises up behind a stately temple. (Curiously, the many-windowed buildings with which Poussin, who had never been there, endows Pharaoh's country now resemble modern resort hotels.)The main interest and beauty of the painting, however, do not reside in its possible symbolism, but in the wonderful grouping of the figures, all women to contrast with an analogous group of men in Christ healing the Blind Man (now in the Louvre), painted for the same patron the year before. Each plays her role in the dramatic tale, the princess generous and commanding, the maids curious and delighted. The humbler figure in a white shift at Moses' head may be his sister who watched from nearby to see what would happen to him, and recommended their mother to Pharaoh's daughter as a wet nurse. It is tempting to see their brilliant draperies as a compliment to Poussin's patron, the Lyon silk merchant Reynon. Bodies and colours, each distinct and separate, combine in ample rhythms across the picture surface, echoed by the rocks beyond. It is at once solemn and joyful, as befits a scene in which a child is rescued from death, and through him an entire people is saved.

44473-catherin.jpg	Legend has it that in the reign of the Emperor Maxentius there lived a girl known as Catherine of Alexandria who was as intelligent and wise in debate as she was beautiful to look upon. During the last years of pagan Rome she emerged victorious from every verbal encounter with the Roman sages and it was for this reason that, at the Emperor's order, on the 25th of November, in the year 307 A.D., she was broken on the wheel and then beheaded. Catherine's emblems are therefore the wheel, the sword, the palm-branch and the book, the first two representing her martyrdom, the others her wisdom.Both her life and her death were favourite subjects for paintings in the Middle Ages, chosen even by the greatest artists of the Renaissance when it was only possible to paint a beautiful woman in the guise of a saint. Thus in this painting by Yá&#241;ez we are shown a gentle young girl with a Leonardo-like smile, colourfully dressed and posed against a richly detailed background. Yá&#241;ez was an artist of the Spanish Renaissance who, though influenced by Italian art, retained the vivid colouring and meticulous detail of the Flemish tradition	YÁ?EZ DE LA ALMEDINA, Fernando	Saint Catherine	Oil on canvas, 212 x 112 cm	1505-10	religious	Spanish	1501-1550

Originally Preti was also supposed to paint the smaller panels above the passages to the presbytery chapels. Because of a litigation, he never actually did so, and the two panels were ultimately executed by the Albani pupils Carlo Cignani and Emilio Taruffi.

25092-joseph.jpg	"Unknown Flemish master, a follower of Rogier van der Weyden. He got his name from the six tondos representing scenes from the Joseph legend of the Old Testament.Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison."

08683-08waterj.jpg	Diderot could have no higher praise of a Chardin still-life than to say: 'C'est la nature m&#234;me.' And for him Chardin remained the great magician-painter whose canvases deceived the eye by their tremendous realism, down to the very textures of the objects painted. Such pictures kept the spectator completely within his own experience, and to some extent that is true of all the pictures painted by Chardin - including those genre scenes which were executed chiefly in the years before Diderot wrote of the Salons, but which are also in their way still-lives. Neither category of picture was novel, and Chardin might seem merely to be practicing what had been among the most typical products of Dutch seventeenth-century painting	CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon	Water Glass and Jug	Oil on canvas, 32,5 x 41 cm	c. 1760	still-life	French	1701-1750

It is not certain that the subject is really the Field Marshal Lucio Foppa, about whom there is little documentation.The only remaining example of the genre of painting for which Figino was famous among his contemporaries, this portrait also reveals the varied influences on the artist. Although it shows reminiscences of Flemish painting, the portrait is more openly ""cavalier,"" with the noble subject posed as if on a stage. The composition plays on the contrast between the closed profile on the right and the open one on the left. The latter relates to the decorative details of the chiseled helmet, the flowers and the feathers, which are all touched by incisive highlights. Notations of light also appear on the lace of the collar and the sleeves, which correspond to the flowers and fruit on the table.

12476-05sorrow.jpg	This work depicts Jesus after he had been scourged and mocked by the soldiers, just before he was led away to be crucified. Jesus bleeds profusely from his wounds and he holds the instruments used to beat him, a three-knotted whip and bundle of birches. He wears the crown of thorns, leaning his head on his right hand in a gesture of grief. His other hand rests on a ledge, a pose which Dürer often used to add a sense of depth to a portrait. The face is painted with great realism. Set against a gold background, Christ stares out of the picture, expressing resignation at his fate.This devotional panel was identified as a Dürer in 1941 and although unsigned it is now widely accepted as a work by the young artist. It dates from his journeyman days and may well have been done in Strasbourg, probably in 1493 or early in 1494	DÜRER, Albrecht	Christ as the Man of Sorrows	Oil on panel, 30 x 19 cm	c. 1493	religious	German	1501-1550
04023-1hunyadi.jpg	"The great solemnity of historical paintings was especially apparent in the large pictures by Gyula Benczúr. His master, Piloty, concerned himself with stage-like scenes from the history of Europe, but Benczúr who great up in Kassa in the turmoil of the War of Independence, felt that it was more important to depict Hungarian history. This early work of his, ""László Hunyadi's Farewell"", alredy shows his particular talent for composition, human characterization and realistic rendering. There is deep sorrow on the face of László Hunyadi, the central figure, and one feels his tragic fate looming over the paintful farewell of his friends, Subdued light falls on the group and is reflected from the white walls that are painted with masterly realism.The great succes of this painting marked the beginning of Benczúr's sparkling artistic career. He first exhibited it in Pest in 1867 and then in Paris with the works of eleven other Hungarian painters. In 1869, the Pest Picture Gallery Association bought it for the Hungarian National Museum. It became so popular that the weekly magazine ""Hazánk"" (Our Native Land) reproduced it as a colour supplement in the 1870s"	BENCZÚR, Gyula	László Hunyadi's Farewell	Oil on canvas, 147 x 121 cm	1866	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

13640-17ferenc.jpg	"The laid table with armchairs around it in the garden of the Ferenczy family often appeared in  Ferenczy's pictures (""Sunny Evening"", 1904, ""Sunny Morning"", 1905, and ""The Prodigal Son"", 1908). ""Sunny Morning"", like ""October"", showed an idyllic scene in a little town. Ferenczy views the bright and  peaceful subject not as a humorous one, his considerations as artist make his pictures more than mere genre pictures. The morning sunshine penetrates under the branches of the walnut tree. Eyes are drawn to the table with white table cloth. Shadows of objects (a fruit basket, apples and a blue carafe) are projected on it, together with the delicate shadow of the basket chair which is not in the picture. The natural posture  of people sitting around the table is a part  of  the arrangement. The edge of the table running diagonally is accentuated by the arm and trunk of the female figure who is leaning back in the armchair and by the borderline between light and shadow on the leaves.Ferenczy's composition at this time was characterized by István Réti as follows: ""... he places his figures into narrow space and full figures. It is carefully decided on the basis of proportions and patches how much of them should be portrayed. Proportion of space is shifted towards figures, what does not diminish the importance of  atmospheres in the pictures ..."". The contrast of surfaces in light and shadow is definite. The way he painted the warm colours of faces which are in the shadow of hats is simply superb, just like the grey silk dress. Ferenczy's style of painting is more dynamic and delicate coloured at the same, mow that he gave up his previous plain style"	FERENCZY, Károly	Sunny Morning	Oil on canvas, 92 x 93 cm	1905	landscape	Hungarian	1851-1900

05801-1simon.jpg	Dirk Bouts came from Haarlem, where he doubtless received his early training. Later he settled in the university city of Louvain, where his major work can still be seen in the Church of St Peter. When he was appointed City Painter in 1468, he was already over fifty years old. The Berlin panel, as its close likeness to the work of Aelbert Ouwater suggests, must have been one of his earlier works.The story of Jesus's visit to the house of Simon the Pharisee is told in St Luke's Gospel (vii, 36-50). A woman from the city followed Christ there, 'and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.' Simon condemned the attitude of his guest, saying : 'This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.' Christ answered with a parable and the words: 'Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.'In a narrow, vaulted room, on the left of which is a window providing a glimpse of a landscape, Simon sits with his guests at a table laid for a meal. On the left of the table the sinner bends down to anoint Jesus's feet. The host, the only one present wearing shoes, and Peter beside him, observe the incident with astonishment and disapproval. The youthful John at the head of the table seems to be drawing the attention of the donor, a Dominican monk, to it. The latter kneels with hands raised in prayer and, as if he dare not look, averts his gaze.The arrangement of the figures at a laid table recalls two other themes from the life of Christ, the Last Supper and the Miracle at Emmaus, incidents which were frequently represented in painting and, furthermore, established a pictorial tradition of their own. Here the table is laid with bread, wine and fish, the last of these being an ancient Christian symbol. The composition of the various objects represents one of the most delightful still-lifes in old Netherlandish painting. Among the vessels on the table one can recognize a late medieval form of glass known as a 'cabbage-stalk'	BOUTS, Dieric the Elder	Christ in the House of Simon	Oil on wood, 40,5 x 61 cm	1440s	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

21141-view_squ.jpg	K&#248;bke is one of the most distinguished of the so-called painters of the Danish Golden Age, whose work represents a brilliant contribution to nineteenth- century European art. He started training as an artist at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen in 1822, and from 1828 became a student of C.W. Eckersberg. K&#248;bke usually painted small-scale pictures of great precision - landscapes, studies of architectural subjects and portraits of his family and friends. Whatever the subject, he invariably combined carefully observed, often richly coloured naturalistic details, with a sense of controlled abstract design.This painting was made in about 1830, when he was developing his mature style, and shows the bakery in the Kastel, which is a castle in Copenhagen that served as a prison. The three figures in the foreground are K&#248;bke's father, who owned the bakery, Major J.J. Krohn, and the slave Sergeant Sporch (the prisoners were described as 'slaves'). The scene was one with which K&#248;bke was very familiar as he lived within the castle compound from 1817 to 1834. In the later 1830s his family moved out of Copenhagen and he concentrated on depicting more rural scenes; subsequent visits to Germany and Italy broadened the scope of his subject matter still further	K?BKE, Christen	A View of the Square in the Kastel Looking Towards the Ramparts	Oil on canvas, 30 x 23 cm	c. 1830	landscape	Danish	1801-1850

Dominating the scene (and painted in as an afterthought) is instructor Jules Perrot, with the huge stick he used to beat out a rhythm.

12572-6apostl.jpg	Dürer's monogram and the date are visible in the upper part of the two canvases, which are part of a series of twelve heads of apostles which the artist planned, though never completed. The two heads are constructed with an incisive and meticulous line, a reflection of Dürer's troubled search for moral austerity. We may recall that this was a particularly delicate time in German history, shortly before the emergence of Martin Luther and the Reformation.The two saints inspire a diffuse sense of solemn veneration, in the passionate, severe eyes, the embittered curve of the mouths, and the overabundant beards, depicted as heavy, noble masses of coiling hair	DÜRER, Albrecht	The Apostles Philip and James	Tempera on canvas, 45 x 38 and 46 x 37 cm	1516	religious	German	1501-1550
33608-13group.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Sampling Officials of the Drapers' Guild	Oil on canvas, 192 x 279 cm	1662	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
11939-sopron.jpg	"The altarpiece of St. George church in Sopron is one of those rare Baroque compositions which are not a simple devotional picture or a copy of one, but a so-called picture in picture. This type of composition, apart from intensifying the pictorial effect, always refers to some important aspects of the history of devotion of the central picture.In the middle of this altarpieces, in an elegant Louis XIV. style golden frame set out whit laurel festoons and bows of ribbons, is shown the image of the Virgin of Genazzano, at that time famous all over the world, with her special appellation written in a banderole: Maria von guten, Rath, Mother of Good Advice (Aurenhammer 1956. 110-111).The prototype of the Eleousa-type devotional picture was an Albanian Treccento fresco from the church of Skutari, delivered from the Turkish invaders in 1467 the Augustinian hermits in Genazzano near Roma. Its veneration spread by means of copies made for other churches of the order, and won popularity through the pious brotherhoods founded for its honour. The cult of the Mother of Good Advice - obviously because of its anti-Islamic aspects - was encouraged by Pope Innocent XI, so in the 17th and 18th centuries it flourished not only within the order but throughout the whole Catholic Church.In Hungary the altarpieces representing the Mother of Good Advice sometimes also show the angels who, according to the legend, flew with the devotional picture and brought it to its place.The representation of this scene may come from a copperplate of Sebestyén Zeller, an engraver in Pozsony. In Sopron, however, the substitution of this usual environment for an allegorical natural landscape transmits an entirely original, thus far unknown  meaning of the iconography of the picture. The tree struck by lightning and the shattered ancient idol with lire, in his hand had already lost much of their topicallity at the time as symbols for the enemies of the pervious centuries (pagans, Turks, the Reformation). The literary products of the Enlightenment which spread even by way of leaflets, engendered a grave spiritual crisis, disrupting even the traditional unity of the clergy. The verse of psalm written in front of the flashing thunderbolts at the two sides of the picture: Verstummen müssen - falsche Lettzen, Ps. 30. v. 19. (Let the lying lips be put to silence, Psalm 31, 18) gives us a very perceptible rendering of the mood of the belivers confused in their traditional religiosity. With the dark clouds in the background Dorffmaister presents us with a picturesque and inventive representation of the shock that befell the faith before omnipotence of reason, and makes us feel the atmosphere of the crisis caused in many contemporaries by awareness of helplessness.It is in this stormy, almost pre-Romantic landscape in this ""mirror of the soul"" that the gentle look of the Mother of Good Advice and that of the Child on her breast might have been an ""apology"" of orientation and inner satisfaction for everybody having recourse to her"	DORFFMEISTER, István	The Mother of Good Advice	Oil on canvas, 167 x 102 cm	1781	religious	Hungarian	1751-1800
43452-leiden.jpg	In their sheer abundance and variety, Van Vliet's paintings of church interiors create the impression of a commercial enterprise. This was nothing new in the world of Dutch art but it was new to the genre in Delft. Van Vliet's production was consistent and systematic. His constant search for new views in the churches of Delft, his trips to other towns and his use of standard schemes indicate work for the open market.The paintings shows a view of the interior in the Pieterskerk in Leiden from the northern transept to the southwest. This is the earliest known dated architectural painting by Van Vliet. It employs Houckgeest's type of oblique perspective scheme, and an illusionistic archway and curtain	VLIET, Hendrick Cornelisz. van	The Pieterskerk in Leiden	Oil on panel, 98 x 82 cm	1652	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
08445-stil_lif.jpg	This still-life with herring, lobster, turbot, red mullet, oysters, gurnard, lemon, chicory root, carrots, onions, terracotta pot and ladle, and straw flask, was executed during the artist's stay in Venice, from about 1736 to 1742. Connections with Venetian painting are evident in the soft, quivering brushwork and the sumptuous, refined sense of colour, enhanced by the bright orange tonalities of the lobster, the brilliant red of the mullet, and the golden yellow of the lemon	CERUTI, Giacomo	Still-Life	Oil on canvas, 63 x 68 cm	1736-42	still-life	Italian	1701-1750

18489-septimiu.jpg	This painting by Greuze is frankly Poussin-like. The artist wished to be recognized as a history painter; he chose an obscure subject to illustrate:  Septimius Severus Roman emperor (146-211) reproaches his son, Caracalla for trying to assasinate him. Varied emotions are at work within it: from Caracalla's angry shame to the surprise of the chamberlain, Castor, at the emperor's recklessly heroic gesture which is at once a challenge and a rebuke	GREUZE, Jean-Baptiste	Septimius Severus and Caracalla	Oil on canvas, 124 x 160 cm	1769	historical	French	1751-1800

29776-resurrec.jpg	In 1491 an altarpiece was commissioned by the brothers of the late Archbishop Leonardo Griffi for the newly constructed chapel of S Leonardo, attached to S Giovanni sul Muro, Milan. The Resurrection was the central panel of this altarpiece. It is assumed that Leonardo da Vinci provided a refined drawing for the composition. The figures of the two saints were painted by Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio.	OGGIONO, Marco d'	Resurrection of Christ with Sts Leonardo and Lucy	Oil on panel	1491-94	religious	Italian	1451-1500
11662-giustini.jpg	Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicit&#224; Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidotti in 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichino in 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Sala di Diana, Domenichino concentrated his pictures on the ceiling, fitting them into a geometrical system patterned after the Galleria Farnese. The pictures depict scenes of the moon goddess Diana	DOMENICHINO	Scenes of Diana	Fresco	1609-10	religious	Italian	1601-1650
24063-2sposi111.jpg	The detail of the west wall shows a grotesque self-portrai of the artist.Hidden in the foliate decor of one of the room's painted pilasters, right next to the painted plaque above the door containing the painter's dedication of the work, is a face that has been commonly identified as the artist's self-portrait. Its resemblance to the bronze portrait bust from roughly 1490 in the church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua, is unmistakable, even though this painted likeness does not wear the arrogant and somewhat surly expression that his contemporaries tell us was characteristic of the artist	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Grotesque Self-Portrait	Walnut oil on plaster	1465-74	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

02622-07arella.jpg	This impressive still-life represents one of the finest achievements by the pre-eminent flower painter of 17th century Spain, Juan de Arellano. The painting was produced at the height of the artist's career and is remarkable for the quality of execution.

38561-cobbler.jpg	This painting renowned work in the eighteenth century, partly due to its dissemination through engravings. It was the source of inspiration for a number of French artists, perhaps most notably Jean-Siméon Chardin. There is a direct connection between the present painting and one of Chardin's work in the Louvre, The Canary, which shows a woman teaching her canary to sing. The two works not only share thematic similarities, but also compositional ones.The painting is signed and dated lower right, on the work bench: 'D: TENIERS &#183; FEC A 1671'	TENIERS, David the Younger	A Cobbler in his Workshop	Oil on canvas, 37 x 28 cm	1671	genre	Flemish	1651-1700

36803-death_a.jpg	Of the many painters who assimilated and vulgarised the contemplative, romantic manner of Giorgione, Sebastiano del Piombo was inspired by the monumental form and by the possibility of making it solemn with the use of colour. It is precisely in this contained plasticism that we find the result of the integration of the two pictorial cultures. This painting shows a still Giorgionesque atmosphere - the view of the lake and the sunset - in which three superb examples of sculptural nudity are inserted: a doleful Venus, and her attendant maidservants, who turn abruptly to silence a bearded Pan who is continuing to play his flute	SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO	Death of Adonis	Oil on canvas, 189 x 285 cm	1511-12	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

44721-farnese1.jpg	The art-historical importance of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, near Viterbo, is the famous pentagonal ground plan and round interior courtyard, and the interior frescoes. The Palazzo was built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) who was made cardinal by his grandfather Pope Paul III (1468-1549), and named vice chancellor of the Holy Roman Church a year later, according him the highest position after that of the pope in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.The architect of the construction, Giacomo da Vignola, found that the form of the ground plan and the site of the building were dictated by an incomplete fortress begun in the 1530s by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger - a project that had not gone further than the exterior walls on the ground floor. Vignola approached the unfinished structure as a challenge and opportunity to create a unique solution. What was built from 1559 onward had the form of a fortress and the function of a villa, but was in its extravagance an urban palace.The commission for the interior decoration went to Taddeo Zuccaro, who was to make drawings and cartoons for the painting and stucco work but he had to work there only to review from time to time the work that had been carried out there. He largely assigned the execution to others, in particular his brother Federico. After the death of Taddeo Zuccaro in 1566, his younger brother Federico continued the work until 1569. His successor was Jacopo Bertoia, then Giovanni de' Vecchi, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio.The principle according to which the walls and ceilings were painted was retained for all apartments: only in public rooms (halls and their antechambers) were frescoes painted on ceilings and walls, while painting in the private rooms was limited to the vaults, with walls covered in silk, brocade, and similar materials. The themes painted in the ground floor apartments, intended for various uses by guests, are all taken from classical mythology.  The themes of the apartments situated above these on the piano nobile focus decidedly on the master of the house and the function of the individual rooms.In the two rooms on the piano nobile suited for a larger public, the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani and the Sala del Concilio, Taddeo Zuccaro painted a cycle depicting, in a total of twenty-three scenes, the history of the Farnese family	ZUCCARO, Taddeo	General view of the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani	Fresco	1562-63	historical	Italian	1551-1600
39463-03adamev.jpg	This work together with the Creation of Animals and the Murder of Abel, created between 1550 and 1553, was originally in the Scuola della Trinit&#224;.Adam and Eve are depicted not in a landscape thrown into confusion by the hand of the Creator but in a more serene, more human dimension. In the leafy arbour the two nude figures moving around the trunk of the tree form the parallel diagonals of the composition. A strong light gives a sculptural effect to their ivory-pink flesh. But in the background, on the right, the tranquillity of the foreground scene gives way to the tumultuous epilogue to the fact of human disobedience to Divine will. With rapid brushstrokes Tintoretto evokes the fiery angel who drives Adam and Eve out into the distant desolate hills and plains.Eve, temptation personified, is pressing close to the tree of knowledge; her arms prolong the line of the serpent thrusting down from above. Tintoretto confidently shows that he has now perfectly mastered not only the sculptural structure of a muscular, sinewy male body (a particular strength of Florentine painters, especially of Michelangelo) but also the reproduction of female grace and tenderness (the domain of Venetian artists, particularly Titian).The model for Adam is a chiaroscuro woodcut by Antonio da Trento	TINTORETTO	The Temptation of Adam	Oil on canvas, 150 x 220 cm	1551-52	religious	Italian	1551-1600

23262-05head.jpg	A fine youthful work but partially repainted. It was done under the influence of Dürer and Jacopo de' Barbari. It is small, but life-size. Even in this work from his earliest period, the sitter's fully frontal posture is characteristic of Lotto's portraits, and so is the lively sense of personality that emerges from the close-up.In the 18th-century inventories the painting appeared as the portrait of Raphael, executed by Leonardo da Vinci, an assumption based on the soft, atmospheric modeling, the intense psychological penetration, and the traditional iconography of Raphael, who had always been seen as a delicate, elegant and refined youth. Recent X-rays, however, have revealed a previous portrait, completely different the one executed	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Head of a Young Man	Oil on wood, 28 x 23 cm	c. 1505	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
04579-playlute.jpg	Bijlert was connected with the Utrecht circle of Caravaggists, who included Honthorst and Terbrugghen, and like them spent time in Rome around 1621.

21468-queen.jpg	Three fancy-dress balls were held at Buckingham Palace by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, each in a different style. At the first on 12 May 1842 the principal figures appeared as Edward III (1312-77) and Queen Philippa (1314?-69). The second, on 6 June 1845, was in early Georgian dress and the third, on 13 June 1851, in the style of the Restoration.Landseer has painted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Throne Room on the occasion of the fancy-dress ball of 1842, standing beneath a specially designed Gothic canopy decorated with purple velvet hangings. Two chairs of state are visible behind the figures and above their heads on the cloth of honour is emblazoned the coat-of-arms of Edward III, combining French and English quarterings. It was from this alcove that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert greeted over 2,000 guests. Members of the Royal Household were expected to appear in costumes dating in style from the reign of Edward III, while the guests were encouraged to wear costumes of any period or country. The setting for the ball and the design of the costumes were entrusted to James Robinson Planche, who was an authority on the history of dress, as evidenced by his encyclopaedic book History of British Costume (1834), as well as a dramatist and a herald in the College of Arms.The costumes worn by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were designed by Vouillon and Laure with the guidance of Planche. For the sake of accuracy reference was made to the relevant monuments in Westminster Abbey. The queen's costume was based upon the effigies of Philippa of Hainault and her daughter Blanche de la Tour (died in infancy 1342), while that for Prince Albert was derived from the effigy of Edward III. Landseer began his painting at the time of the ball, but, as was so often the case with this artist, progress was delayed and the picture was not finished until 1846.

39256-09george.jpg	St George and the Dragon is a small, even miniature, painting in the context of Tintoretto's work, detailed and highly finished. It was probably commissioned as a private altarpiece, and the conventional arched vertical format had never before, and has rarely since, been used to such dynamic and disturbing effect. The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground. St George has galloped into the painting from our right, the direction of a hidden source of light which picks out the trunks of the trees, the rump of the horse, the armour of the knight and the flesh and garments of Cleodolinda	TINTORETTO	St George and the Dragon	Oil on canvas, 158 x 100 cm	1555-58	religious	Italian	1551-1600
42379-council.jpg	The most famous admiral in Dutch history, Michiel de Ruyter, enjoyed an international reputation and received numerous honours from other countries. De Ruyter was born in Flushing port in 1607, and first went to sea when he was only eleven years old. His navigating skills brought him rapid advancement. De Ruyter was employed by the Admiralty, in Zeeland in 1652 and in Amsterdam a year later. As vice-admiral of the fleet he took part in the numerous sea battles the Dutch fought against England. In 1665 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet. He won a number of victories, but the pinnacle of his career was undoubtedly the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672-1674), in which his superior tactics enabled him to keep a large Anglo-French fleet away from the Dutch coast. De Ruyter was killed at Syracuse in 1676, and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam.This pen drawing by Willem van de Velde depicts the council of war on the eve of the four-day naval battle during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667). The battle, which took place on 11-14 June 1666, was won by the Dutch fleet under De Ruyter's command. The result, however, was disappointing: the English fleet was not destroyed, and losses on the Dutch side were almost as great	VELDE, Willem van de, the Elder	The Council of War on Board 'De Zeven Provincien', the Flagship of Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter, on 10 June 1666	Oil on canvas, 117 x 175 cm	1666	historical	Dutch	1651-1700

04413-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.

43366-sacra_co.jpg	The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date. The panel is signed and dated on the dais of the throne	VIVARINI, Alvise	Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Sacra Conversazione)	Tempera on wood, 175 x 196 cm	1480	religious	Italian	1451-1500
19904-02seymou.jpg	Jane Seymour (1509-1537) was the third wife of King Henry VIII of England and mother of King Edward VI. She succeeded - where Henry's previous wives had failed - in providing a legitimate male heir to the throne.Jane's father was Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, Savernake, Wiltshire. She became a lady in waiting to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then to Anne Boleyn, who married the King in 1533. Henry probably became attracted to Jane in 1535, when he visited her father at Wolf Hall, but, though willing to marry him, she refused to be his mistress. That determination undoubtedly helped bring about Anne Boleyn's downfall and execution (May 19, 1536). On May 30, 1536, Henry and Jane were married privately.During the remaining 17 months of her life Jane managed to restore Mary, Henry's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, to the King's favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and some scholars have interpreted Jane's intercession to mean that she had little sympathy with the English Reformation. The future Edward VI was born on October 12, 1537, but, to Henry's genuine sorrow, Jane died 12 days later.Holbein executed this portrait shortly after the marriage of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. In attitude and expression, the Seymour portrait matches that in the Whitehall composition, but the portraits differ in the arrangement of the bonnet veil; this individual portrait follows the preparatory study in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. This change is important only from a compositional point of view, and probably derived from Holbein himself. However, the major changes in tonality and patterns in Jane's gown will probably have been undertaken only after consultation with the client.Holbein's portrait depicts a figure frozen in an official sense of responsibility. The simplicity of the shadowed background accentuates the increasing richness and boldness of design and adornment in Henrician court fashion, and the artist's skill is pre-eminent in creating the sheen and lustre of the precious stones. Great attention has been paid to the realism of the silver thread in the queen's dress, and this new opulence was to be echoed in the portrait of Henry himself.

07438-certosa.jpg	The exquisite painted decoration of the chapels of the church in the Certosa di San Martino, done both in fresco and in oils, was executed by prominent representatives of the younger Neapolitan school of painting, who were greatly influenced by Caravaggio. Of the works in fresco painting, the most outstanding example is the vault of the San Gennaro chapel, painted by Caracciolo in 1632 with four scenes from the life of the patron saint of Naples. His highly compressed compositions with their wealth of figures and drapery almost threaten to burst through the frames of the relatively small picture panel	CARACCIOLO, Giovanni Battista	Scenes from the Life of St Januarius	Fresco	1632	religious	Italian	1601-1650
07946-rest_f_e.jpg	"During his years in Rome, Annibale was an enthusiastic exponent of a cleansed classical art. He paid tribute to it in the amazing ceiling that he spent the last years of his life painting in the Palazzo Farnese. On this, and also on the large landscape lunettes in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Annibale was helped by young assistants, nearly all from Emilia, who subsequently established the classical style there that proved to be so successful. Annibale Carracci's reputation as an ""academic artist"" and the fact that for over three centuries he has been regarded as a paradigm of classical style, has meant that for too long we have overlooked his no less fascinating handling of nature, evident in his Landscape with the Flight into Egypt. But the melancholy which can be glimpsed in that landscape, whose symmetry almost anticipates Poussin's, overwhelmed Annibale as a man and he stopped painting toward the end of his life. Fortunately, his true place in art has been recognized by recent critical works"	CARRACCI, Annibale	Rest on Flight into Egypt	Oil on canvas, diameter 82,5 cm	c. 1604	religious	Italian	1551-1600
17072-paris22.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 363, JH 1351.The sitter in this portrait was the colour-merchant Tanguy, a Breton peasant who had settled in Paris and ran a small paint shop in the Rue Clauzel, much frequented by vanguard artists. His shop had become a kind of gallery of their paintings, for Tanguy would take paintings on deposit as credit for the painting materials he supplied. Van Gogh painted two portraits of Père Tanguy in the autumn and early winter of 1887, both against a background composed of Japanese colour woodcuts which he had begun to collect, firstly in Antwerp and then more avidly in Paris. Tanguy is placed massively in the centre of the canvas, facing the spectator. But the Paris merchant is presented not against an urban or even French setting, but in an imaginary context composed of Japanese seasonal scenes and costumed figures. Although this choice of background indicates van Gogh's evident preoccupation with Japanese prints - he also made individual copies of selected prints at this date - the painting does not indicate any profound influence of Japanese graphic styles or perspectival devices upon his work. But it is important to note that the motifs represented in the prints anticipate those that van Gogh would shortly resume when he left Paris and moved once again into a more rural setting - seasonal landscapes and portraits of regional types in costume.In his portraits of ordinary people van Gogh emphasized their sadness, dignity and kindness. The Portrait of Père Tanguy is a good example	GOGH, Vincent van	Portrait of P?re Tanguy	Oil on canvas, 92 x 75 cm	Autumn 1887, Paris	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
18320-1208grec.jpg	Painted for the high altar of the Colegio de Do&#241;a Maria, Madrid. The retable no longer exists, and the paintings are dispersed. The subjects of the paintings of the retable are not recorded, but it is assumed that they illustrated the Life of Christ. For reasons of size, style, and subject matter, the following paintings probably came from the retable: the Annunciation, the widest painting, in the centre (the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation); the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ, two paintings of the same size, on the left and right of the Annunciation; the Crucifixion above the Annunciation; and the Resurrection and Pentecost, another pair of identical size, flanking the Crucifixion (the whole forming a retable of a type known in the Escorial). Such an arrangement gives a chronological sequence to the events of the Life of Christ. The payment of 6000 ducados (for the paintings and retable) indicate a large commission. Small versions, probably models, exist for the three paintings more generally accepted as belonging to the retable, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ.Probably originally on the right of the retable of the Colegio de Do&#241;a María, balancing the Adoration of the Shepherds, and painted at the same time. A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome. A later development of this subject, only treated once before, in the Modena Triptych, is the painting for the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, Toledo, probably completed after his death by Jorge Manuel. The pose of the Christ is related to that of the Saint Sebastian of c. 1580. The bipartite composition can be related to the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, the portraits giving place to the range of angels. The splendid ecstatic figure of the angel, between the Baptist and Christ, is one of a number of such symbols that he began to introduce into his painting. If his figures - the actual participants in the action - become increasingly dematerialised, these new symbols appear as emotions materialised in gesture and colour	GRECO, El	The Baptism	Oil on canvas, 350 x 144 cm	1596-1600	religious	Spanish	1551-1600

35488-25mythol.jpg	The story, depicted in the painting is part of the legendary history of Athens and it has echoes of a primitive fertility rite. It tells how Vulcan, in a clumsy attempt to ravish Minerva, accidentally let his semen spill over the ground, and Mother Earth, thus fertilized, gave birth to Erichthonius. Minerva shut the infant in a basket, which she entrusted to the three daughters of Cecrops, king of Attica, forbidding them to open it. But one of them, overcome by curiosity, did so and discovered that the child had a serpent's tail for legs (or that a serpent lay beside it). Maddened with terror the three threw themselves from the top of the Acropolis. Erichthonius, brought up by Minerva, became king of Athens.The three sisters are depicted in the act of opening the basket, out of which a snake uncurls itself. The infant lies inside. Mother Earth is represented by a statue of Diana of Ephesus, the many-breasted goddess of fertility. The theme is most often found in 17th century Netherlandish painting	RUBENS, Peter Paul	The Discovery of the Child Erichthonius	Oil on canvas, 218 x 317 cm	c. 1615	mythological	Flemish	1601-1650
39766-11claris.jpg	Clarissa Strozzi was the daughter of Roberto Strozzi and Maddalena dei Medici, who lived in exile in Venice from 1540 to 1542. Along with the portrait of Ranuccio Farnese, this painting is the second enchanting child's portrait Titian painted in 1542. Clarissa is feeding her little dog, but, like Ranuccio, is looking at something taking place outside the picture. This again creates a vivid sense of movement.

00334-portra1.jpg	What strikes us in this portrait is the convincing compromise between the formal purity acquired from Bronzino, the predilection for enlarged forms drawn from Michelangelo, and the balanced, rhythmic spatial models of Raphael, for Allori was a truly skilled alchemist in combining these various influences in a dignified way.The lady portrayed is certainly Bianca Cappello, already painted by Allori in a fresco which now hangs in the Tribune of the Uffizi.On the back of the portrait is an allegorical scene, the Dream of Human Life	ALLORI, Alessandro	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on copper, 37 x 27 cm	1570-90	portrait	Italian	1551-1600
04775-landsca2.jpg	This painting is the pendant of the Landscape with a Fountain, also in the Hermitage.

08877-0view1.jpg	Most of the frescoes in the transept of the upper church of San Francesco, as well as in the apse, were executed all at once by Cimabue and his workshop. Cimabue, who came from Florence, is the first of the mural painters active in Assisi who can be identified by name. The subject matter of the extensive pictorial program that was executed under Cimabue's direction in the transept and the apse is based for the most part on the dedications of the altars in the western section of the church. A thirteenth-century inscription indicates that the altar in the south transept was dedicated to the archangel Michael; the high altar, to the birth of the Virgin; and the altar in the north transept, to the apostles or to Peter and Paul. Accordingly, the apse had scenes from the life of the Virgin, culminating in the Assumption; the south transept had motifs from the Apocalypse and a large Crucifixion on the east wall; the north transept arm had scenes from the lives of the apostles and another large Crucifixion; and the crossing vault had the evangelists.The scenes from the life of the Virgin in the apse of the Upper Church represent the first large program dedicated to Mary in the history of Italian painting. The paintings of the upper registers are almost entirely destroyed. The four large fields of the basamento to the left and right of the papal throne are dedicated to the death and glorification of the Virgin. The Assembly of the Apostles by the Virgin's Deathbed is followed by the Death of the Virgin and the Assumption. The final painting, shown here, represents the Virgin as intercessor, sitting on the heavenly throne alongside Christ. They are flanked by angels, patriarchs, prophets, saints, and Franciscans.

12384-tobias.jpg	Karel Dujardin's classically styled biblical scenes, produced mostly in his Amsterdam period between 1659 and 1674, betray the influence of the schools of Rome and Bologna in general, and, on occasion, of Annibale Carracci in particular. The Old Testament story of Tobias became popular in seventeenth-century Dutch art, especially in Rembrandt's circle. One of the most commonly treated scenes was that in which the young Tobias, at the behest of his accompanying angel, caught from the River Tigris an enormous fish, whose gall he used to heal his blind father Tobit	DUJARDIN, Karel	Tobias and the Angel with the Fish	Oil on canvas, 85 x 65 cm	1664-65	religious	Dutch	1651-1700

39299-01ceilin.jpg	"This oval painting is part of the ceiling decoration in the Sala dell'Albergo. After his arduous life of wanderings, narrated by the paintings in the neighbouring church, Roch finally reaches heaven, its angelic choirs, and the supreme vision ""face to face.""The spirit of Michelangelo, who had only recently died, seems to permeate this ceiling picture. While the figure of God the Father is reminiscent of the Creator in the frescos of the Sistine Chapel, his encounter with the rising St Roch suggests Titian's famous Assunta, the epoch-making altarpiece of 1516/18 in the nearby Frari church, showing the Assumption of the Virgin. The muscular figure of the saint, patron of the victims of the plague, and the attractive representatives of the nine choirs of angels, slightly reminiscent of Gothic cathedral sculpture, seem to stand on the edge of an opening in the roof itself.

05414-italian.jpg	Jan Both was one of the best known of the Dutch painters living in Italy for varying length of time in the 17th century (the so-called Italianates). They painted landscapes without depicting a specific topography and almost all their works are imaginary compositions. Both's painting - although includes a draughtsman - is no exception. It shows a waterfall and a small gorge overgrown with bushes and trees close to a country road with a bridge which has just been crossed by a travelling party consisting of a carriage drawn by two horses led by grooms. By the side of the road are three groups of two figures each, all wearing rather rustic garbs.Judging by their poses and the sheet of paper held by one of them they are artists surveying the countryside. Opening up on the right is a broad view of the Roman campagna.

But to the modern observer his own description of the picture, written shortly before it was ready for the 1825 Academy exhibition - 'calm &#38; exhilarating, fresh &#38; blowing' - applies more happily to the sketch; the greatest sufferer in the finished canvas is the sky, which has lost its bubbling clouds	CONSTABLE, John	The Leaping Horse	Oil on canvas, 142 x 187 cm	1825	landscape	English	1801-1850

11024-503david.jpg	David's first history painting in exile was an extremely original and disturbing interpretation of the late antique myth of Cupid and Psyche. It was painted for the wealthy Italian patron and connoisseur Count Giovanni Battista Sommariva and, although planned in Paris, it was only finished in Brussels in 1817.As related by the Roman writer Lucius Apuleius in The Golden Ass (late second century AD), Cupid, the god of love, fell in love with the beautiful Psyche and brought her to his palace, where he visited her every night without ever letting her see his face. But curiosity got the better of her, and one night Psyche looked at Cupid while he was asleep. Unfortunately a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp and awakened him, whereupon he abandoned her and the palace disappeared. From then on Psyche was condemned to wander the earth and perform impossible tasks in the vain hope of winning her lover back.Many other artists saw the lovers as innocent, tender and poetic, but David deliberately drew attention to the sexual aspect of the relationship. Normally Cupid was shown as a beautiful young man, but David depicted him as a grinning adolescent who seems proud of his recent conquest. A great contrast is set up between Cupid's coarse ruddy features and awkward angular limbs, and the pale, smooth and languid beauty of the sleeping Psyche. Unusually for David, the colours are bright and intense; in Brussels he looked at the colours used by Flemish Renaissance artists such as Jan van Eyck.

During the 1660s the level of snowfall increased significantly and two of the harshest winters were in 1662-63 and 1671-72. Dutch artists, among them Jacob van Ruisdael and Klaes Molenaer produced many winter landscape in this period. Molenaer's winter scenes are characterised by a great interest in the harmony and balance between the figures and their surroundings, more akin to the work of the Haarlem painter of the previous generation, Isack van Ostade, than the atmospheric landscapes of Jacob van Ruisdael.The landscape elements in the present scene are broadly repeated in other works by Molenaer.

In 1487, Bastiano Mainardi, a native of San Gimignano who was a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, painted on the north wall of the church (to the left  of the choir) a depiction of St Gemignanus seated on his bishop's throne. Three local notables kneel before the city's patron saint. Below this scene there is a painted monument, with an inscription explaining that Strambi is buried here.

31268-adoratio.jpg	This panel presents a number of compositional and symbolic peculiarities: St Joseph is represented in the background, visible in the middle through the door of the hut, grazing the ox and the donkey, usually depicted next to the Infant Jesus; angels playing long flutes take the place of the shepherds and Magi; the white bird on the beam of the roof (a dove?), perhaps an allusion to the Holy Spirit that descended to Mary. The Virgin's usual blue cloak is adorned with the star of the Byzantine tradition and behind her hangs a humble saddle. The Infant St John has significantly handed the cross, symbol of the Passion, to the child, who, as was common in Tuscan painting, is lying on a sheet and a sack. The figure of the Madonna, like those of the angels, fits in perfectly with the curved edge of the panel, perhaps painted to celebrate a birth, as was customary at the time. Tradition and innovation are fused in this painting, of which there is another version in the Hermitage, considered by some the original and by others a replica of the tondo in the Galleria Borghese	PIERO DI COSIMO	The Adoration of the Christ Child	Oil on wood, diameter 140 cm	1505	religious	Italian	1451-1500

It is signed in Latin on the paper on the base: ""JOANIS BAPTISTA CIMA / CONEGLIAN(ENS)IS.""Cima must have been attracted at a very early age to Venice, where he was fascinated by the elder Bellini and Antonello da Messina. From them he acquired a pictorial repertory suited to his work on a provincial circuit, and like Montagna and Alvise Vivarini, he propagated their approach to painting on the mainland and in Emilia. His work, however, has richer colour and warmth, through the influence of Giorgione.This altarpiece shows Cima's typical mixture of the archaic and the modern. The impeccably harmonious fifteenth-century construction of architecture and figures is accompanied by a modern sunny atmosphere and a landscape steeped in luminous vapour.

40892-03tripty.jpg	An impression of Ghent panel painting in the shadow of the leading masters is provided by a number of works from religious institutions in the city that have been attributed to local workshops on stylistic grounds. There is, for instance, the Triptych with the Family of St Anne. This work prompted the coinage of the name 'The Master of the Family of St Anne', an anonymous artist to whom several other panels in Ghent have been attributed. The most clearly discernible influence in his work is that of Van der Goes' realism	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Triptych with the Family of St Anne	Oil on panel, 87,4 x 92,5 cm (centre), 87,3 x 37,1 cm (left), 87,4 x 39,2 cm (right)	1490s	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
42811-5braida.jpg	Framed by a concave aedicule with double Corinthian columns, this large painting adorns the high altar of the church, the reconstruction of which materially involved Veronese's patron Michele Sanmicheli in 1552. After the completion of the architecture of the high altar, i.e. soon after 1564, work started on the iconographically unconventional altarpiece under the influence of Tridentine reformist ideas. It omits the gruesome torture of the martyrdom, concentrating instead on the saint's moment of intercession. The central figure is incorporated in a group composition full of movement. The scene of the martyr's unclothing is exaggerated by the presence of the Madonna in a bank of clouds accompanied by Sts Peter, Paul and the cardinal virtues Faith, Hope and Charity	VERONESE, Paolo	Martyrdom of St George	Oil on canvas, 426 x 305 cm	c. 1564	religious	Italian	1551-1600

43705-bouquet.jpg	The Vienna-based painter Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller was a master of modest pleasures, a laureate of the status quo.

19057-cabinet.jpg	"At the time, it was a royal passion to put together collections of ""naturalia et artificialia"" and to display them on shelves in ""Kunstkammer"" (""art cabinets""). The cabinets of curiosities (also known as Wunderkammer, Cabinets of Wonder, or wonder-rooms) were encyclopedic collections of types of objects belonging to natural history, geology, ethnography, archaeology, religious or historical relics, works of art (including cabinet paintings) and antiquities.

35717-ruined_c.jpg	Panoramic views of the flat plains in Holland are often said to be the most distinctive contribution of Dutch landscape painting. They differ from the 'world panorama' of earlier Flemish art by seemingly recording the momentary view of a single scene, rather than being composed of a collection of separate visual memories. Formally, they are characterized bb a low horizon line, implying a low viewpoint. Although Ruisdael, perhaps the greatest and the most versatile Dutch landscape specialist, did not invent this type of picture, he became one of its most distinguished practitioners.This painting may represent a view in Gooiland, a district to the east of Amsterdam; there are, however, at least four other, smaller landscapes by Ruisdael that show the same view or part of it with considerable variations, and it is clear that he was not attempting strict topographical accuracy. Despite the pretence of spontaneity, this work, like all landscape paintings of the time, is a synthetic product of the artist's studio.Its dominant feature is the sky, to which two thirds of the picture surface is devoted and which is also reflected in the water of the foreground. This is the real, moisture-laden sky of Holland billowing with clouds, the sun breaking sporadically through scattering shafts of light across the countryside - effects which Constable was later to emulate. Almost more remarkable than the truthful record of the shape, density and illumination of the clouds is the illusion that they are moving through space and over our heads (we tend to think that perspective does not govern cloudscapes, but these seem to taper towards the horizon and broaden at the upper edge of the painting). The long horizon too seems to extend beyond the frame, broken only by church spires and the tiny white sails of a windmill. But our sense of inhabiting the landscape is compromised by our viewpoint in relation to the foreground. By letting us look down into the bastion standing below the horizon line, the painter suggests that we are viewing it from some improbably high place, higher also than the shore on which the peasants graze their flock (both figures and animals were painted by Adriaen van der Velde, a division of labour quite common in Dutch landscapes). This implied detachment, however, strengthens the elegiac mood aroused by the sight of overgrown ruins, melancholy reminders of a distant and more heroic past	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church	Oil on canvas, 109 x 146 cm	1665-72	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

He was buoyed with energy and explored the area for motifs. The present painting was most probably painted among the first group  of works that the painter executed after his arrival. For this painting the artist chose a farmhouse with a thatched roof  and two women working in the garden in front.

13403-15arnol.jpg	"""The Arnolfini Marriage"" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him"	EYCK, Jan van	Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife	Oil on oak, 82 x 60 cm	1434	portrait	Flemish	1401-1450

20083-11hooch.jpg	This painting, also titled as A Merry Company with Two Men and Two Women, is one of the first genre pictures by De Hooch in which the figures rise above the level of soldiers visiting inns and in which the setting makes tentative claims to gentility. De Hooch took the ideas from Anthonie Palamedesz and Jacob van Velsen in Delft and from many painters in other cities. The Visit  represents the domestication of a social theme that had earlier been set mostly in taverns and bordellos. In slightly later years De Hooch would depict more luxurious rooms and superficially more polite behaviour than he did in this key work of his early maturity	HOOCH, Pieter de	The Visit	Oil on wood, 68 x 58 cm	c. 1657	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
41643-paradise.jpg	This painting is monogrammed B and dated 1576. The anonymous painter is referred to as Monogrammist B of 1576, but he is perhaps identical with Joost de Beer (active 1550, d. before 1595 in Utrecht). He transformed Dürer's famous Adam and Eve engraving into a panel painting. He placed the Fall of Man scene into the centre of a paradise landscape. In the distant background the episode of Creation of Adam can be seen	UNKNOWN MASTER, Netherlandish	Paradise with the Creation of Adam and the Fall of Man	Gum tempera on wood, 70 x 94 cm	1576	religious	Netherlandish	1551-1600
10917-lamentat.jpg	This type of Piet&#224;, whether or not accompanied by other holy women, appears more than once in Gerard David's oeuvre and was adopted on various occasions by painters of his circle such as Adriaan Isenbrant or Ambrosius Benson. A model drawing may have existed in David's studio or perhaps there was another prototype by his hand which is now lost. On closer examination David seems here to have built on both Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling.The composition of the scene is a kind of reprise of Memling's Reins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges). Here too, the scene is set in front of a landscape with on the left buildings intended to represent Jerusalem and on the right a group of rocks which serves as a repoussoir. The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which he placed at Christ's disposal, has been hewn out of the rocks here. Wearing a turban and exotic clothing he stands in profile before the tombstone, while Nicodemus enters the tomb. With Memling it is a Roman sarcophagus which stands in front of the rock and which is being opened by Joseph and Nicodemus. The composition itself, with the body held almost upright under the armpits and the head nodding to one side, derives from the right wing of Hugo van der Goes' Lamentation diptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The figure of the Virgin placed parallel along Christ's body with her arm diagonally across it is an adaptation in reverse of the Virgin's posture in Van der Goes. The same is probably also the case with the position of the squatting Mary Magdalene. The St John, with his right knee and foot in frontal view, is also borrowed from Memling's Reins triptych. The spire in the landscape is probably intended to suggest Bruges' Our Lady's Church	DAVID, Gerard	Lamentation	Oil on oak panel, 39,4 x 31,7 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
07663-carlev08.jpg	The painting affords a view of the Serenissima's most characteristic quay: the Molo, with the columns of San Marco and San Todaro (or Teodoro) framing the entrance to the city. On the left stands the Ducal Palace, rendered in minute detail. The steep perspective in which the building is captured continues into the background along the Riva degli Schiavoni. Cast in contrasting light and truncated by the upper border of the image, the column of San Todaro dominates the scene. Between it and the column of San Marco the mast of a schooner appears in the background; it marks the central axis of the composition. Together with the large schooner on the right, the column of San Todaro to some extent counterbalances the buildings which occupy the left side. There is much activity both on the water and in the Square, where most of the figures are gathered in small groups.This view of the Molo and the Ducal Palace towards the east is highly unusual. Instead of depicting the Palace frontally, Carlevaris turned a quarter circle so that we look down the façade of the building towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a composition he also used in four later works. The vantage-point in all these works is from the loggia of the Library, directly opposite the Ducal Palace.Although the architecture dominates the composition, the artist paid close attention to the human figures. Drawn or painted studies for several of the macchiette have survived. Scenes of people and situations drawn from everyday life were introduced to Italy in the first half of the seventeenth century by Dutch painters active in Rome. In the course of the century the so-called Bamboccianti cast such everyday scenes with growing frequency against a &#151; sometimes identifiable &#151; urban background. One of these painters was Johannes Lingelbach, whose work seems to have inspired Carlevaris's vedute. The Venetian artist is thought to have spent some time in Rome, where he could have become familiar with Lingelbach's work.Carlevaris's town views are also deeply rooted in the Venetian tradition of depicting historic or festive events. His View of the Molo with the Ducal Palace, however, does not document a procession, reception or other festivity; rather, it subordinates the human figures to a portrayal of one part of the city in meticulous, topographically correct detail from an unorthodox point of view	CARLEVARIS, Luca	The Molo with the Ducal Palace	Oil on canvas, 70 x 118 cm	c. 1710	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

22145-ludovisi.jpg	This sensitive portrait of Ludovico, turning his head to meet the gaze of the viewer, must have been painted by Ottavio Leoni shortly after Ludovico, a protégé of Pope Gregory XV (1621-1623), became cardinal. Wearing the ring symbolic of his new office, his lively right hand grasps the chair, while his left hand languidly holds a letter, likely alluding to Ludovico's duties as secretary of state.

43965-2tripti1.jpg	"The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier. Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck. It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier. Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background. This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or ""Chinese apple"", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors. Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the ""devotio moderna"". This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life. In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him. This is why the angel Gabriel appears before Mary dressed in an immaculate alb and magnificent brocade cope, as if he had come to celebrate mass, rather than deliver a message"	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	The Annunciation	Oil on oak panel, 86 x 93 cm	c. 1440	religious	Flemish	1401-1450
21261-port_man.jpg	This small double-sided panel bears a portrait of a man on one side and a depiction of a girl making a garland on the reverse. The identity of the young man is not known.

35820-ferrybo.jpg	With far-reaching stylistic similarities in their monochromatic, tonal treatment of the subject, Salomon van Ruysdael's river landscapes and those of Jan van Goyen from the 1630s are almost indistinguishable. However, around 1645 the first-named artist discovered the pictorial possibilities of the tree motif in compositions, through the work of his much more famous nephew Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael, in which this element plays a key role. This gave his variations on the theme a new impulse, and between 1645 and 1655 he painted a series of peaceful, limpid views with which he reached the summit of his art. With the cautious expansion of his palette and the more self confident style typical of these years, his work is also much more distinctively his own.The compositional structure to which this landscape owes its attractiveness is of a bold simplicity. A quarter of the way up the picture the horizontal axis intersects a vertical axis provided by the dark silhouette of a group of trees rising up on the opposite river bank. This divides the picture into two zones, of almost identical size, but in formal contrast to each other. In the left half each individual motif, under a highly atmospheric sky, bathes in an aura of lightness and weightlessness, contrasting with the right half, where mass and volume are piled up in the form of a farmstead, overshadowed by the tree group. Within this constellation even the ferry in the left foreground, laden low with a four-in-hand and a large number of passengers, appears like a fallen leaf carried along effortlessly by the river, the connecting feature stretching through this landscape.Within Salomon van Ruysdael's work, catalogued by Wolfgang Stechow, this painting represents an exception from his otherwise typical use of diagonals in his compositions. But whenever in later works he returns to this traditional pattern, this Ferryboat appears to have been a key work for the discovery of new waterside motifs, providing the viewer with variety and entertainment during his visual walk along never-ending river banks	RUYSDAEL, Salomon van	The Ferryboat	Oil on canvas, 91 x 130,5 cm	1647	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
27081-oyster_e.jpg	Mieris's work are marked by the exceptional thoroughness of details, an effective variety of textures, and a smooth manner of painting akin to that of enamel miniatures. The everyday subject has an obvious erotic subtext: the richly furnished interior and elegant attire mask the vice that is cultivated in this establishment dedicated to gratification. The gentleman offers oysters, a symbol of lust and base pleasures.

05008-findmose.jpg	This painting and The Feast of Dives (Accademia, Venice) are considered Bonifacio's masterpieces. He has used the subject as an excuse to paint an open-air holiday scene, in which the luxuriousness of the clothes melts into the opulent landscape dotted with little genre scenes. In overall decorative effect, the painting is much like a tapestry. Bonifacio's sources of inspiration include Titian and Dosso, with some influence from northern European painters.

44680-tribuna.jpg	The painting has become one of the most celebrated images of eighteenth-century taste. Zoffany shows a group of connoisseurs and members of the nobility admiring works of art in the Tribuna, the principal room of the Uffizi in Florence, which was the most famous gallery in the world during the eighteenth century. The Tribuna had been built by Francesco de' Medici in 1585-9 to a design by Bernardo Buontalenti as a showcase for the most precious items in the Medici collection. Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale. In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture. The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor. The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772. Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray. Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael. For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion. The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici. These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene. In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force. The attention to detail and texture involves not just the portraits, but also the copies after the works of art nearly all of which are identifiable. Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.

43243-elegant.jpg	In the magnificent gardens of a country palace a group of young and fashionable figures have assembled for a banquet beneath the trees. It is an early example of f&#234;te galantes painted in the Netherlands in the early seventeenth century that would prove hugely influential on Dutch painting, especially in Haarlem, for a generation or more. Esias van de Velde, Willem Buytewech and Dirck Hals, were, for example, all directly influenced by Vinckboons's examples	VINCKBOONS, David	Elegant Party in an Ornate Palace Garden	Oil on oak panel, 51 x 98 cm	1610s	genre	Flemish	1601-1650

33455-19oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 521.The story of David and Bathsheba is in the Bible (II Sam. 11 :2-17). One evening while he walked on the roof of his palace David saw below him a beautiful woman bathing. This was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite who was then away on service in David's army. In an act of seignorial arrogance he had her brought to the palace and made love to her. She became pregnant as a consequence. Later he wrote to Uriah's army commander saying, 'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle . . . that he may be smitten and die.' This indeed came about and David afterwards married Bathsheba. The child survived only a few days. David subsequently did penance.Bathsheba is usually depicted at her toilet in various states of nudity. Earlier Renaissance artists show her clothed and merely washing her hands or feet, helped by attendants. Sometimes a messenger is shown arriving with a letter, though the Bible does not record this detail. David's morally indefensible conduct did not deter the medieval Church from drawing a typological parallel: he prefigured Christ and Bathsheba the Church.Rembrandt's painting shows Bathsheba as she receives the message of King David summoning her. The sculpture-like position of the woman is inspired by antique reliefs	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Bathsheba at her Bath	Oil on canvas, 142 x 142 cm	1654	mythological	Dutch	1601-1650

39243-02creati.jpg	One of the major achievements of Tintoretto's early works is the series of canvases painted in about 1550 for the Sala dell'Albergo of the Scuola della Santissima Trinitá. And of these the Creation of the animals is certainly unique for the swirling rhythm of the composition. In a blaze of golden light, which does not entirely escape the darkness still partly enveloping the newly created earth God the Father is portrayed as if suspended in mid-air in the act of creation. The animals rush forward from behind him while the birds shoot across the sky and the fishes dart through the water like arrows from his hand. The dramatic wind-swept scene is furrowed by the profiles of the animals which cross the canvas in running lines, conveying with extraordinary concision and expressiveness the theme of the work.Like Pietro Aretino's novel on the subject of Genesis, Tintoretto's painting shows the unicorn (right). The alleged curative and decontaminating qualities of the narwhal tusk, an essential item in every Renaissance cabinet of curiosities, were regarded as proof of the existence of this fabulous creature. Exotic creatures like the ostrich walking on the shore were much admired as gifts from guests to the princely courts of northern Italy, and were portrayed in drawings or engravings. As a true Venetian, however, Tintoretto here devotes particular artistic skill to the fishes, including sturgeon, salmon and red mullet.Tintoretto's model for this composition was Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery, London); he adopted the flying divine figure as well as the setting.

35698-water_m.jpg	Besides the Bentheim Castle, another motif Ruisdael discovered on his trip to the Dutch-German border region was the water mill. The half-timbered overshot and undershot mills he favoured were found in the eastern provinces of the Netherlands and in the area near Bentheim. Of course, earlier artists included watermills in their pictures but he was the first to make them the principal theme of a painting. The subject became one of the specialities of his pupil Meindert Hobbema, and today, when we think of them, his paintings not Ruisdael's come to mind. But in judging their respective accomplishments it is helpful to recall that Ruisdael painted powerful ones, such as Two Water Mills and an Open Sluice, which impresses by the cohesion of its forms and clear daylight effect, before Hobbema held a brush in his hand	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Two Watermills and an Open Sluice	Oil on canvas	1653	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
44046-1diptych.jpg	The two small panels, representing the Madonna and St Catherine of Alexandria, respectively, probably formed a diptych.The busts of prophets on the outside of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck were the model for the bust of God the Father at the top of the left panel. The figures of Adam and Eve were from the same source. The picture is usually regarded as an early work by Rogier himself from the years 1432-35, but the figure of the Madonna is probably after Jan van Eyck's Madonna of the Fountain, dated 1439, in Antwerp.The right panel is rather weaker, and is not by the same painter as the Madonna. As a king's daughter, Catherine has a crown, but she has taken it off, perhaps a sign of humility and reverence before the Madonna, and has placed it on the ground to lie there ignored. The wheel, her attribute, refers to the failure of the attempt to break her on the wheel; the martyr was finally beheaded with a sword	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Diptych	Oil on oak panel, 18,5 x 12 cm (each)	c. 1440	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

31738-01figure.jpg	Pissarro's landscapes include the people who live and work there; unlike his Impressionist friends Monet and Renoir, these are not city people who travel to the country to relax on the weekend, but peasant farmers and their wives, herdsmen, and shepherdesses.

19686-westerke.jpg	The works of Jan van der Heyden, one of the finest city-view specialists, are responsible for our general impressions of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite.Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building.Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal	HEYDEN, Jan van der	View of the Westerkerk, Amsterdam	Oil on panel, 41 x 59 cm	1670s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
03766-031madon.jpg	"Of all the still youthful Madonnas by Bellini the masterpiece is the so called Greek Madonna of the Brera Gallery in Milan, which entered the Museum in 1808 following the Napoleonic repression. It was originally in the Ducal Palace in Venice. According to some sources the figures were originally set against a gold background, on which the words ""Mother of God"" and ""Christ"" were written in Greek (hence the name of the painting). Obviously, a background of this type would have made it archaic and ""archaizing"", considerably accentuating the Byzantine appearance of the panel, a veritable Marian icon. The 1986 restoration has established that the still remaining traces of gold beside the Greek letters were a 16th-century addition, while Bellini had originally conceived the sky as it appears now: blue and almost entirely covered by a small curtain held up by a cord. Over the traditional preparatory ground (gypsum and animal glue) he had sketched out the preliminary drawing, marking in with extreme precision even the chiaroscuro with subtle and highly regular criss-cross strokes which can be seen in infra-red photography. This technique used by Bellini must have been famous if Paolo Pino in his Dialogo di pittura (1548) writes that ""drawing the painting with such extreme diligence, composing it with chiaro and scuro as Giovanni Bellino was wont to do"" was to be discouraged ""for it is work thrown away since everything must be covered with the colours"".This type of drawing shows similarities with the rigorous Flemish constructive technique, though under closer scrutiny it appears to be aimed at a search for a much more solid and volumetrically constructed plastic quality. The delicate imperturbability of the Madonna, which would always remain a distinctive feature of Bellini's Virgins, shows not only its aforementioned Byzantine-iconic roots, but also how much the artist's culture owes to this heritage"	BELLINI, Giovanni	Madonna with the Child (Greek Madonna)	Tempera on wood, 82 x 62 cm	1460-64	religious	Italian	1451-1500

09530-selfport.jpg	Occasionally a painting contains extra information, about the scene itself, for example, or about the artist. This self-portrait by the Amsterdam painter Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen tells us important facts about his life. The note with the date 1533 and the house mark between an I and an A appear to announce that Iacobus Amstelodamensis, or Jacob of Amsterdam, painted this portrait of himself in 1533. It is known from the archives that Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, the person behind the name Jacob of Amsterdam, must have died before 18 October 1533, the date of a document stating that his wife was a widow. That and the date on the Self-Portrait appear to be conclusive evidence that the artist did indeed die that year.However, it has been suggested that he was dead by 1532, when one of his houses was sold. So 1533 or 1532 - it is not known for sure. On top of that, there are doubts about when the Self-portrait was actually executed. It is very close in style to the paintings that Jacob Cornelisz made around 1525, and he is not known to have made any more after 1526. It is possible that the date was added later, in the year of his death, and that we are looking at a Van Oostsanen who is younger than he appeared in 1533.There is another panel in which the same man is seated before an easel, painting the portrait of an older woman. It is by Dirck Jacobsz, the couple's son, who traced the head in the Rijksmuseum Self-Portrait and used it for the man by the easel. He then added his mother's likeness, creating an anachronistic scene: a portrait of his father as he probably looked before 1533, and one of his mother as she appeared around 1550	CORNELISZ VAN OOSTSANEN, Jacob	Self-Portrait	Oil on panel, 38 x 30 cm	1533	portrait	Netherlandish	1501-1550

07264-canal714.jpg	The Royal Hospital at Greenwich was completed in 1752, over half a century after it was begun. Canaletto painted this depiction of it soon afterwards. It shows the view, which has altered little, through the centre of the hospital complex to the Queen's House, and on towards the Royal Observatory at the top of the hill beyond.Canaletto has created a slightly 'wide angle' effect by combining what can be seen of the hospital from two separate viewpoints which are set a little way apart on the near side of the Thames. He has slightly broken the potential symmetry of the composition by studying the buildings from a little left of centre. In addition, the monotony of the river is relieved by the considerable variety of craft that is travelling up and down it, and also by the unrelenting verticals and horizontals of the design which are countered by the bold diagonal of the mast of the ship grounded at the right.The river and architecture were established first by the artist, and the boats then painted over the top; it is just possible to see the buildings through the sails of the boat to the left of the centre of the picture	CANALETTO	London: Greenwich Hospital from the North Bank of the Thames	Oil on canvas, 66 x 112,5 cm	c. 1753	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

28483-winter_l.jpg	Momper is rightly regarded as the most important Flemish landscape painter between Pieter Brueghel and Rubens. Brueghel's influence is clearly evident in this winter landscape, and it is quite probable that his son Jan also painted a number of the figures in this picture.Momper's personal achievement lies in his rendering of landscape as a picturesque subject matter in its own right. What we see here is no longer a great universal landscape full of symbolically charged allusions, but a scene whose aesthetic appeal is valued for its own sake. Momper's painting is divided into various planes by a kind of backdrop, against which silhouettes are highlighted by a pale light or dark, thundery clouds. People are making their way along tortuous paths on terrain that seems to be hazardous.Rain-laden stormclouds, sunshine and snow set the atmosphere of the painting. In this respect, Momper has taken an important step towards emancipating the landscape painting as an autonomous genre in which the landscape is not merely a setting for some event, but is treated as a subject matter in its own right	MOMPER, Joos de	Winter landscape	Oil on panel, 49,5 x 82,5 cm	c. 1620	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650

One of these sons became king of Epirus after Pyrrhus' death.Pyrrhus and Andromache are characters in the tragedy ""Andromaque"" written in 1667 by Jean Racine (1639-1699), a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France (along with Molière and Corneille), and an important literary figure in the Western tradition."

13439-alfieri.jpg	"Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803)was an Italian tragic poet whose predominant theme was the overthrow of tyranny.To glorify the personality of this writer of tragedies, Fabre has clearly added to the faithfulness of the portrait a heroic tone, evident in the facial expression and the pose of the raised arm over which the brown mantle is slung all'antica.Beyond its value as a historical document, the work is also a striking example of the more severely classicistic current which emerged from the school of David, of whom Fabre was a pupil and close follower.The painting is signed and dated in the lower right corner, ""F. X. Fabre Florentia 1793"", and on the reverse bears a famous sonnet written by the poet, dated 18 August 1794"	FABRE, François-Xavier	Portrait of Vittorio Alfieri	Oil on canvas, 93 x 73 cm	1793	portrait	French	1751-1800

24243-view2.jpg	The painting represents a capriccio of an imagined cityscape with Saint Mark's Basilica and ruins on the banks of a river. This imagined riverside town is typical of the spirited and picturesque landscapes created early in the career of Michele Marieschi. The artist includes celebrated and instantly recognizable edifices, such as Venice's Saint Mark's Basilica here, and places them side by side with fantasy buildings and crumbling ruins.  The artist is not bound by rules of perspective: the ruined columns and the tower overgrown with greenery are painted to a completely different scale than the houses directly opposite them on the other side of the river at right. They dwarf the figures beneath them, who cross the bridge between the two sides	MARIESCHI, Michele	Capriccio of a Riverside Town	Oil on canvas, 51 x 75 cm	c. 1735	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

Although fictive openings in ceilings and vaults had already been created in painting in the sixteenth century, permitting vivid views of events taking place in heaven, the heavenly visions of the seventeenth century take on a new quality, scale, and intensity. The supreme example is the ceiling composition executed by Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Il Ges&#249;, the most spectacular of a fresco program encompassing virtually the entire church that Baciccio worked on for thirteen years (1672-85). In earlier examples the architecture served as the framing for the pictures, in Il Ges&#249; the relationship between architecture and painting was redefined: painting and decoration are confined to those portions of the church structure of greatest symbolic importance	BACICCIO	Cupola decoration	Fresco	1676-79	religious	Italian	1651-1700

These window framings, with their nude youths atop festoons of fruit, are primarily decorative displays of artistic virtuosity; at the same time they contain elements - for example the tondo with the chiaroscuro depiction of Time revealing Truth - that can likewise easily be seen as referring to the theological content of the frescoes as well as to the work of the confraternity	SALVIATI, Cecchino del	Illusionistic window	Fresco	1536-53	religious	Italian	1501-1550

On the left, a whale is being 'flensed'. On the right, the strips of blubber are being chopped up on wooden tables and boiled in huge vats.

33936-aurora.jpg	During Guido Reni's second stay in Rome he directly tackled themes from classical Antiquity. While this composition was openly derived from classical art, it was meant in the spirit of purest love and has a genuine if rather insipid beauty.Though a ceiling decoration, it is composed in the form of a frieze as if painted on a wall.

37933-celtwin.jpg	Even the ritual of the lying-in visit, associated with childbirth, was not spared Steen's parodying brush. In the Twin Birth Celebration he depicts a hilarious and witty scene of a flustered elderly father who is mocked by a throng of clamorous women as he receives his newborn twins. Steen's old man must be impotent &#151; since common wisdom held that the aged were infertile &#151; and therefore completely incapable of having sired one infant, let alone two. A younger, virile man must have fathered them as the old fool, much to his consternation, has suddenly realized	STEEN, Jan	Twin Birth Celebration	Oil on canvas, 69 x 79 cm	1668	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

26380-puddlers.jpg	Meunier found his main subject in about 1880: man at work. from 1885, he also turned to this particular subject in his sculpting. The title of this relief is a reference to the puddling and Krupp burning process used in iron-making. Only a small area of the blast furnace, the actual place of work, is shown on the right-hand edge of this relief. The middle one of the three labourers is one of the most impressive to be seen in any of Meunier's works. His right foot is pressed against the furnace, his torso is stretching backwards. Every muscle, every sinew is tensed as he works the iron with all his strength.Meunier's labourers are types rather than individual people and are idealised.

39286-1mark.jpg	The painting is the first of a series of works, painted in 1548 for the Scuola Grande di San Marco while Marco Episcopi, his future father-in-law was Grand Guardian of the School.The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearence of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of the saint against his master's will. The scenes takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light, while the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.In keeping with the drama of the action is the tight construction of the painting, the dramatic fore-shortening of the forms and sudden strong contrast of light and shade	TINTORETTO	The Miracle of St Mark Freeing the Slave	Oil on canvas, 415 x 541 cm	1548	religious	Italian	1551-1600

The eagle which is to devour his liver every day - Prometheus' punishment for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mankind - is hovering ominously in a corner.

The hat band which is casually draped across his shoulder provides an artistic frame for the young man's face.The sitter of the portrait is probably Gianlorenzo de' Medici, and it could very well be Botticelli's first commissioned work, and from the hair and the clothes, the portrait must date from no later than 1469	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Portrait of a Young Man	Tempera on panel, 51 x 33,7 cm	c. 1469	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

A rush of water carrying away a broken tree, a house huddled on a slope, and tiny figures beneath a clouded sky - all these components make it possible to see the painting as a piece of 17th-century speculation on the romantic opposition of man and the elements	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Waterfall in Norway	Oil on canvas, 108 x 143 cm	1668-72	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

Three shady characters, their faces hidden or turned away, are pulling, dragging and pushing the cross to which Peter has been nailed by the feet with his head down.Caravaggio's St Peter is not a heroic martyr, nor a Herculean hero in the manner of Michelangelo, but an old man suffering pain and in fear of death. The scene, set on some stony field, is grim. The dark, impenetrable background draws the spectator's gaze back again to the sharply illuminated figures who remind us, through the banal ugliness of their actions and movements - note the yellow rear and filthy feet of the lower figure - that the death of the apostle was not a heroic drama, but a wretched and humiliating execution	CARAVAGGIO	The Crucifixion of Saint Peter	Oil on canvas, 230 x 175 cm	1600-01	religious	Italian	1551-1600

14668-2refecto.jpg	Taddeo Gaddi was Giotto's most important student, belonging to his workshop for twenty-four years. He produced a number of frescoes in Florence and Pisa, besides numerous panel paintings, but until his death in 1366 he was mainly active in Santa Croce, the Franciscan monastery in Florence, and his house and workshop were nearby. His late works, from around 1360, include the fresco of the Crucifixion in the sacristy and the ensemble of paintings grouped around a Tree of Life (Arbor vitae) in the refectory of Santa Croce.The picture shows the interior of the refectory in Santa Croce in Florence. The frescoes were commissioned by the woman in the garments of a Franciscan tertiary kneeling at the foot of the cross, behind St Francis.

(Matthew 1:7)Astonishing naturalness and a large variety of poses characterize the figures in the last lunettes, which are known to have been painted with great rapidity.On the left a woman is depicted in profile; she sits alone, gazing out into the chapel, leaning backward with her elbow on the back of the seat. This is a detail that is only found here, and it may be compared to the low step on which, on the other side of the lunette, the sleeping young man rests a foot. The woman's right arm and hand are stretched out on her leg, while her left hand points to the unborn child she is carrying in her womb.The young man at right is seated bent forward in an attitude of complete abandon. His head, with his face turned toward the wall, is resting on the hand placed on his right knee; his other arm hangs down at his side. Behind him, a young boy seems to be trying to make him sit upright by grabbing his shoulder. The juxtapositions of bright colours in the woman's clothes - a green scarf over her head and shoulders, a violet-rose pinafore, a reddish-orange mantle with yellow ocher lining - are matched by equally rich, but more delicate, tones in those of the young man"	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	Rehoboam - Abijah	Fresco, 215 x 430 cm	1511-12	religious	Italian	1501-1550
38614-revelle1.jpg	The picture shows a countryside inn with revellers enjoying an afternoon's drinking, the innkeeper chopping wood in the foreground, and a pastoral landscape beyond. Teniers delighted in the portrayal of peasant revelry for the scope of characterisation and gesture that it afforded him. Drink is always present in his peasant scenes, and usually the cause of the subject at hand.It is noteworthy that the figures in the present image are larger than usual.The painting, which formerly belonged to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, is signed and dated on a rock lower centre left: D.TENIERS.

26062-17rein.jpg	This small triptych is the second altarpiece to be commissioned from Memling by a brother at St John's Hospital in Bruges, the first being the Floreins triptych. The donor has been identified as Adriaan Reins on the basis of the initials AR on the frame and the figure of St Adrian who protects him in the left wing. Reins was received into the Order in 1479, and died in 1490.The principal scene is a Lamentation on Golgotha beneath a glowering evening sky. The left wing represents the donor with his patron saint, while the right wing features St Barbara, the hospital saint par excellence.The composition is a development on an idea of Rogier van der Weyden, who was the first to reduce the Lamentation to its three principal protagonists (apart from Christ) in a number of smaller compositions. The body with its stiff, open arms and closed legs, knelt over by the praying Virgin, first appears in another work by the same master, namely the Lamentation in The Hague (Mauritshuis). The scene as a whole is portrayed in deep and sombre tones. The predominance of purple - including the marbling of the frame - means that the altarpiece is literally enveloped in the colour of the Passion.Two versions of this Lamentation are known: the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych in Rotterdam and the Rome Lamentation, both of which were probably painted at an earlier date. The former in particular may be seen as the immediate compositional predecessor of the Reins triptych.Doubts as to the authorship of the work were expressed from an early stage, probably because the figures of St John and Mary Magdalene did not meet the idealised Memling image that had been formed by the nineteenth century, and because of the lack of an inscription with the artist's signature. Despite these doubts, this little triptych is a masterpiece, executed with the utmost delicacy.The central panel was partially copied (landscape, Christ and St John) in the Santa Barbara Lamentation by a follower of Memling from the late fifteenth century	MEMLING, Hans	Triptych of Adriaan Reins	Oil on oak panel, 43,8 x 35,8 cm (central panel), 45,3 x 15,3 cm (each wing)	1480	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

12113-children.jpg	Although Drouais made his career primarily as a society portrait painter in the tradition of Largillière and Nattier, his portraits 'déguisés' were very different from theirs. Instead of court ladies depicted in the guise of antique goddesses, Drouais chose to depict his ladies and gentlemen (and especially their children) in pastoral guises (say, of shepherds and shepherdesses) or as members of different, perhaps less fortunate classes such as harvest workers or Savoyards. The present portrait depicts the two sons of the Duc de Bouillon dressed as Montagnards. One holds a marmot with a ribbon and the other plays a hurdy-gurdy, both activities associated exclusively with the people of the mountains especially in Savoy and in North Italy.The painting is signed lower centre: Drouais le fils 1756	DROUAIS, François-Hubert	The Children of the Duc de Bouillon	Oil on canvas, 86 x 130 cm	1756	genre	French	1701-1750

He holds out his arm toward that of the Lord, who, borne aloft amidst a flight of angels, stands out brightly against the shell of shadow of his huge purple mantle.

08420-figures.jpg	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene (see at Angeluccio) and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone"	CERQUOZZI, Michelangelo	Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue	Oil on canvas, 130 x 97 cm	1640s	landscape	Italian	1601-1650
19371-5hayez.jpg	"The painting is also known as Meditation on the Old and New Testaments.The darkened glance of the beauty in this painting is not really directed at the viewer. She is sunk in thought, looking out of the canvas in a pre-occupied way. In her right hand she holds a folio bearing the words ""Storia d'Italia"", this is to say a symbol of knowledge. Her left hand holds the symbol of faith, the Cross, that has played so great a part in Italy's history. Her naked breast is highly provocative when seen with the black cross of mourning. She is perhaps the allegory of Italy in the 19th century, and the gaze with which this figure of ""Italia"" confronts the viewer creates a suggestive, almost hypnotic effect. She seems to be in a state between waking and dreaming. This is meditation that has not yet reached a solution, meditation in which grief predominates"	HAYEZ, Francesco	Meditation on the History of Italy	Oil on canvas, 90 x 70 cm	1850	portrait	Italian	1801-1850
35473-11mythol.jpg	Venus and her son Cupid are being offered food and wine by Ceres, goddess of the fruits of the field, and Bacchus, god of wine. The subject comes from a line by the Roman comic poet Terence (d. 159 BC) which frequently figures in the emblem literature that developed from the mid-16th century: 'Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus' - without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus would freeze. Love is impossible without food and drink. Rather than depicting a boisterous feast, Rubens has opted for a rather restrained scene that must be read as a plea for moderation in pleasure.Rubens produced this painting a few years after his eight-year stay in Italy, where he was employed at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, and also in Rome. The knowledge of antiquity he gained then was put to use in this painting, as also in a later work on the same theme in 1614, (Royal Fine Arts Museum, Antwerp), Ceres' pose being taken from the Crouching Venus of the Hellenistic sculptor Doidalsas, dating from around 240-230 BC. Rubens certainly knew the marble copy in the Farnese collection in Rome (today in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples).What he particularly appreciated in Hellenistic and Roman sculpture was its formal dynamism, although he saw in ancient sculpture generally a realm of flawless, ideal nature. In painting from such antique models, he says in his De Imitatione Statuarum, a treatise 'on the imitation of sculpture', the statuary has to be humanised, translated into flesh and blood.

24925-metropo2.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine	MASTER of the Acts of Mercy	Giving Drink to the Thirsty (exterior)	Oil on fir panel, 74 x 47 cm	1460s	religious	Austrian	1451-1500

17065-paris15.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 313, JH 1251.This picture shows an inviting restaurant in Asnières. Van Gogh's unique facility for communicating his feelings directly by means of his brushwork is already in evidence. The light and the associated atmospheric effects have become the actual subject of the picture, very much in the spirit of the Impressionists. Although still restrained, the painting is defined in terms of colour by contrasting complementary colours: blue and orange, red and green.By the middle of 1887 a dramatic change of style has occurred in van Gogh's work. Using these characteristically 'impressionist' motifs of a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, van Gogh seems to have been willing to experiment with Impressionist techniques as well. However, the painting lacks a sense of substance and conviction, which reflects his difficulty in feeling himself as part of the world he is portraying.In the two years van Gogh spent in Paris he tried to assimilate French Impressionism, only to find that a new generation of painters were questioning its premises regarding both subject-matter and style. His flirtation with Impressionist subject-matter was brief; encounters with the Neo-Impressionists led him to believe that Paris could no longer be the subject of modern French painting	GOGH, Vincent van	Restaurant de la Sir?ne at Asni?res	Oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm	Summer 1887, Paris	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
35316-sketch1.jpg	This painting is an oil sketch (modello) for the principal altarpiece in the east transept of the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg, built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) between 1696 and 1707. This altarpiece is one of the most important works from Rottmayr's later period. The modello is a smaller version of the six-meter high altarpiece and reproduces the elongation and distortion of the figures which create the perspective of the altarpiece itself.St Charles Borromeo was the intercessor for people stricken with the plague. In response to an outbreak of the plague epidemic in the city of Salzburg, processions are held and Holy Communion is administered following the example of St Charles Borromeo. Rottmayr defined the location of the event by depicting recognisable features of the Salzburg landscape and architecture.Rottmayr's style of painting was shaped by and bears the imprint of his schooling in the Italian, and above all Venetian, art of painting in the sixteenth century	ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael	Apotheosis of St Charles Borromeo	Oil on canvas, 130 x 58 cm	c. 1721	religious	Austrian	1701-1750
24307-10marko.jpg	Markó often interrupted his stay in Italy for the sake of paying a visit to Hungary. This work, made in 1853, is considered a rarity, because, except for a few works during the earliest period of his career, he never painted Hungarian landscapes. Although his art can largely be classified as late neo-classicist, this time Markó chose a romantic motif. He depicted the Puszta, the region of the country which is still thought to be the most special and the most interesting, with a sweep-pole well, its mandatory symbol. A rainbow glows in the stormy sky. One is reminded of the anxiety felt before a storm by the ponderous, dark clouds. Besides the subject of the painting, its style also shows the traits of romanticism, with special regards to its composition which is built on the contrast between light and dark.

14015-1zenob01.jpg	The Villa Zenobio in Santa Bona Nuova, near Treviso, was built between 1673 and 1689 and was profoundly reworked during the mid-eighteenth century when the garden wing was erected. The small entrance portego was decorated in the early years of the eighteenth century by Gregorio Lazzarini. In 1744, the villa was acquired by Sebastiano Uccelli (1695-1768) who can be credited with the renovation of the villa. He commissioned Francesco Fontebasso to paint frescoes in the ballroom of the new garden wing.Frescoes unfold across the ceiling and walls of the vast ballroom, as well as beneath the open gallery. The ceiling fresco depicts The Magnanimity of Scipio, while the wall frescoes focus on the narration of episodes from the life of Queen Zenobia and represent The Banquet of Zenobia and Triumph of Aureliano. However, the interpretation of these scenes is debated	FONTEBASSO, Francesco	View of the ballroom	Fresco	1745-50	interior	Italian	1701-1750
23081-6roadto.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church.This scene has the tragic cadence of a procession of Flagellants, like the ones used to travel along the roads of Umbria on Good Friday, accompanied by the singing of lauds and marching to the rhythm of their scourges	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Road to Calvary	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350
40266-organ_2.jpg	In 1469 the cover of the organ of the Cathedral in Ferrara was painted by Tura. The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. The shutters were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.Light is effectively rendered as an expressive device without becoming a particularly naturalistic component, striking here and there, helter-skelter, although a certain concentration on the left may be isolated. Highlights are also found on the right-hand edges of forms, especially in the canvas showing St George impaling the dragon. Color is equally antinaturalistic. The tight-fitting leather costume of the saint is outlined, pale maroon against a golden sky. His gray horse, ferociously participating in the confrontation, is accentuated by a calligraphic arrangement of thin red straps. There are strong echoes of Mantegna, perhaps in part filtered through Squarcione, in motives like the rendering of the winding trail with figures on the hill behind the princess and a tight application of paint, which permits abundant minuscule detail. Critics have called attention to connections with later Donatello, especially with his reliefs made for nearby Padua. These are difficult to isolate within the personal expressive idiom of the St George, except for the shared intensity in treating sacred figures and narratives	TURA, Cosm?

12298-21badia.jpg	Painted with the 'Master of the Badia at Isola'. With regard to this anonymous master it is worth recording that in all probability he was at the beginning in such close relations with Duccio as to lend credibility to the opinion that Duccio's hand can be detected in some of his early works. As an example can be cited the very beautiful Madonna no. 593 in the Pinacoteca of Siena whose face is really so close to Duccio's Crevole Madonna that it could easily be attributed to him and dated to that period	DUCCIO di Buoninsegna	Madonna and Child (no. 593)	Tempera on wood, 63 x 49,5 cm	1280s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08528-1lands02.jpg	Cézanne's main work was done in landscapes. He painted the river valleys of the Ile-de-France and, above all, his beloved hard, bright, sunbaked Provence.

A magnificent garland of meticulously painted flowers and fruits reflecting the diversity of nature frames the idyllic scene like a triumphal arch. It forms the letter M for Mary, who is seated as in a ""beszlozzenen garten"" or hortus conclusus dominating the middle ground with the Christ child on her knee. Beside her are the angels and the lamb, slightly behind her is Joseph and in the background is a view of a landscape with grazing deer.

18091-1orsini.jpg	"This little panel was part of a predella from an altarpiece of the Madonna, Angels and Saints, which was commissioned by the Confraternity of the Purification of the Virgin, in Florence. On October 23, 1461, the contract for the painting was drawn up. It is a remarkable document in the number and precision of its stipulations and instructions. The painter was asked to use Fra Angelico's altarpiece at San Marco as a model and to execute the entire work by his own hand, with the greatest care. One clause stated that ""...the said painting must go beyond all the good painting done up to now by the said Benozzo, or at least should be comparable in quality...""The artist scrupulously observed the conditions of the contract. His composition is clearly articulated, with the initial episode of the narrative placed in the middle ground.

41899-cafaggi.jpg	The picture showing the Villa Medicea at Cafaggiolo is one of the 14 paintings in lunette form which represent the Medici villas. They were made by artist in 1599-1602 for the third grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I.The Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo was one of the oldest and most favoured of the Medici family estates. The villa was reconstructed following designs of the architect Michelozzo in 1452, becoming a meeting place for some of the greatest intellectuals of the Italian Renaissance. The Medici visited it often: as a consequence, the villa was the scene of many momentous events in the history of the dynasty, ranging from the reception of Medici brides to the murder of a Medici wife	UTENS, Giusto	Villa Medicea, Cafaggiolo	Fresco	1599	landscape	Flemish	1601-1650
25276-05educat.jpg	The Golden Legend, drawing on the apocryphal gospels, tells how the Virgin Mary was brought up as a child in the Temple at Jerusalem 'with other virgins'...and was visited daily of angels', since it had been foretold to her parents, Joachim and Anne, that their daughter was to be consecrated to the Lord as the 'chosen vessel' of Christ's Incarnation. The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character. Mary is seen in earlier examples teaching her young companions, sewing the priest vestments or being ministered to by angels who bring bread and water. But the favourite theme, especially in Counter-Reformation art, depicts her education in the strict sense, at the knee of her mother Anne, learning to read.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art	MAULBERTSCH, Franz Anton	The Education of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 60 x 30 cm	c. 1755	religious	Austrian	1751-1800

18487-selfport.jpg	Greuze was in his late 50s when he conceived of this portrait of himself. It was a difficult period for him personally, because his notoriously difficult marriage was finally coming apart, but at the same time he was painting some of his most important genre pictures. In these he created scenes from contemporary life that combined an unblinkered view of the world around him with a style derived from the grand manner of the traditional historical painter. His penetrating insight into his subjects' motivation and personality is also evident in the portraits and self-portraits of which he made many at this time.

Ancient tradition credits him with extraordinary talent as a goldsmith.St Eligius in His Workshop remains to this day the best-known and best-loved painting of Petrus Christus. It shows two young fiancés who have brought the patron saint of goldsmiths a quantity of precious metal to be melted down and fashioned into rings as token of their love. Christus gives us an extremely detailed representation of the goldsmith's shop. Not only are there all the instruments of the trade, but also many liturgical objects, carefully arranged on shelves. There is also a convex circular mirror on the right-hand side of St Eligius's table, in an obvious allusion to the Arnolfini Marriage by Jan van Eyk. In it we can see the reflection of a square, with a couple of passers-by. Although the presence of the saint gives the work a religious dimension, this remains essentially a genre painting: that is, a representation of secular and commercial activities, a scene from everyday life	CHRISTUS, Petrus	St Eligius in His Workshop	Oil on panel, 98 x 85 cm	1449	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

08247-23oldtes.jpg	Not until 1900, during restoration work in the church, did large sections of the old fresco decoration come to light again. The middle register of a depiction of the Last Judgment on the west wall of the basilica, fragments of the fresco of the Annunciation on the north wall, and two scenes from the story of Jacob on the south wall were uncovered. It is assumed that there were cycles of the Old and New Testament, respectively, on facing walls of the nave.The fragment of Jacob's Dream is on the south wall of the nave	CAVALLINI, Pietro	Jacob's Dream (fragment)	Fresco	c. 1300	religious	Italian	1251-1300

24095-4judith.jpg	Once owned by King Charles I of England, this painting illustrates an episode from the Old Testament which relates how the Israelite Judith by guile killed the Assyrian general Holofernes and thus saved her beleaguered city. Painted with minute detail, Judith and her handmaiden finish their deed with tragic calm.Among Mantegna's works there are several representations of Judith that, without exception, show a comparatively peaceful scene in which Judith is placing the severed head of Holofernes in a bag. During the Baroque, in contrast, the dramatic central moment of the action was preferred, as Judith, often with great effort, decapitates Holofernes.

08037-leblond.jpg	A sister-in-law of Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Rosalba Carriera achieves the same airy lightness of touch as her relative in her portraits. These were done in pastel and in them she explored the finest shadings of her subjects' characters, the most fleeting of their moods. Thus, without falling either into the dangers of the encomiastic portrait or of the documentary, Rosalba matches the immediacy of pastel technique to the freshness of her psychological and social penetration of her subjects, offering an unrivalled picture of the society of her time. In the Elderly Lady the mature beauty of the noblewoman and her serene good-natured existence are conveyed with incomparable skill. No less typical of her work is the portrait of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac with its superb rendering of the physical features of the subject, catching immediately the wilful character of the prelate.The artist uses her pastels with consummate skill in conveying the fresh innocence of the Young Lady of the Le Blond Family	CARRIERA, Rosalba	Young Lady of the Le Blond Family	Pastel on paper, 34 x 27 cm	c. 1730	portrait	Italian	1701-1750
14509-burning.jpg	This work of Froment's maturity, which is indeed an epitome of his whole oeuvre, was commissioned by King René of Provence. This central panel of the triptych represents Moses before the Burning Bush; the figures kneeling in prayer on the wing are the donor and his wife, Jeanne de Laval, accompanied by saints (not reproduced here). In this work the painter has abandoned the occasional crudities of The Raising of Lazarus; only in the countenance of Moses are there reminiscences of the more rigid portraiture of the earlier altarpiece. Moses is struck with astonishment at the vision before him and the appearance of the angel. The vision occupies the upper centre of the picture: amidst a great circle of flaming rose bushes the Madonna appears in a richly draped mantle, holding the Child. Christ holds a mirror in his hand, in which both of them are reflected. The picture contains a number of emblematical representations. The combination of a number of unusual elements side by side is characteristic of mediaeval symbolism. It is evidence of the extraordinary cult of the Virgin in the Middle Ages that it is she who appears before Moses, and not God, as in the Old Testament	FROMENT, Nicolas	The Burning Bush	Wood, 410 x 305 cm	1476	religious	French	1451-1500

40348-01prato.jpg	Those sections of the fresco cycle that are attributed to Paolo in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption in Prato Cathedral display a perfect compositional organization, created through a precise perspective pattern that places the simple, elegant buildings and the numerous human figures within a perfectly balanced spatial rhythm. Each of the characters has a different expression, evidence of a research into facial characteristics which will later become typical of Uccello's painting.In the scene of the Disputation of St Stephen, for instance, the beautiful face of the saint and those of the characters standing around him are portrayed with strongly marked expressions, in some cases even grotesque, in the attempt at giving each one individual characteristics. Behind this group of figures there is an architectural construction that is reminiscent of Brunelleschi's buildings. The accuracy and the perfect perspective of the drawing of this building is repeated also in the constructions in the background of the Stoning of St Stephen, for this reason correctly attributed to Uccello; the scene of Stephen's martyrdom, on the other hand, is the work of Andrea di Giusto	UCCELLO, Paolo	Disputation of St Stephen	Fresco, 300 x 360 cm	c. 1435	religious	Italian	1401-1450
24384-pandemon.jpg	"In the 1820s Martin produced a series of paintings depicting scenes of disaster, set in infinite, visionary spaces and full of theatrical, nightmarish lighting effects. Their basic mood largely derived from the artist's familiarity with John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost and with the biblical Apocalypse.The Pandemonium of 1841 goes back to a passage in the first book of Milton's Paradise Lost, in which ""Pandemonium, the palace of Satan, rises suddenly built out of the deep."" In a diagonal perspective characteristic of Martin, a gigantic building complex extends along the waterfront. This recalls fantastic reconstructions of cities of antiquity. Martin's Satan, whose invocatory figure stands on a rocky outcrop in the right foreground, has the look of an ancient Greek hero. Like Achilles outside Troy, he appears with shield and feathered helmet, but commanding an army not of besiegers but of demons and damned souls in their Cyclopean city"	MARTIN, John	Pandemonium	Oil on canvas, 123 x 184 cm	1841	other	English	1801-1850

33318-closedey.jpg	"This small painting is one of the painter's best-known works and is typical of Redon's symbolism. It shows a female face framed by long hair, painted in delicate and thinly applied colours. The woman's eyes are closed, her gaze directed inwards. The unreal blue of the background distances the face in the same way as the horizon. The head, absorbed in itself, is not a portrait. It could just as easily be called ""The Dream"" or ""Meditation"" - titles such as these occur again and again in Redon"	REDON, Odilon	Closed Eyes	Oil on canvas, 44 x 36 cm	1890	other	French	1851-1900

00894-30east.jpg	This scene is the right half the lunette on the east wall. The left half depicts St Stephen being led to his martyrdom.In this scene he is portrayed at prayer following the description that 'he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.' (Apostles 8, v. 60). Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses.

05555-12marull.jpg	According to Berenson, the sitter of this portrait is Michele Marullo (1453-1500), known as Tarcaniota, a Greek humanist, who was the guest of the Medici's between 1489 and 1495. Later, in 1496, he returned to Florence and married the woman poet Alessandra Scala. He left Florence in 1490 and soon after he died by drowning into the river Cecina.This painting can be considered an ideal scholar portrait, a forerunner of those portrayals of philosopher-heroes developed in the seventeenth century, e.g. by Luca Giordano.The painting is in a very poor state of preservation	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Portrait of a Man	Tempera on canvas transferred from wood, 49 x 35 cm	c. 1490	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

07998-magnani.jpg	"This scene is part of the frescoed frieze painted in 1588-91 by the Carracci in the salone on the piano nobile of the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. The frieze depicts in 15 scenes the stories of the founding of Rome. The iconographical program of the frieze precisely follows the story of ""Parallel Lives"" by Plutarch. Each scene is accompanied by a motto written on a scroll beneath each box.One of the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. The twin brothers were purported to be sons of the Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their murderous uncle, they were abandoned at birth and put into a basket that was then placed into the River Tiber. The basket ran aground and the twins were discovered by a female wolf. The wolf nursed the babies for a short time before they were found by a shepherd. The shepherd then brought up the twins.When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them. The brothers quarrelled over where the site should be and Remus was killed by his brother. This left Romulus the sole founder of the new city and he gave his name to it &#150; Rome. The date given for the founding of Rome is 753 BC.Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf is the first scene of the cycle. It was executed by Lodovico Carracci.

37843-delazara.jpg	This polyptych is one of the very few surviving work that is universally considered to be by Squarcione. In a frame designed in a sophisticated late Gothic style are four side saints conceived like coloured sculpture on marble bases, unrelated of the conception of the central image. The focus of devotion, St Jerome, is in a different scale and has a different background than the surrounding saints.

In contrast to Gerrit berckheyde, he did not limit himself to more or less accurate renderings of reality.

25095-ursula.jpg	The present panel can be considered among the finest examples of the Master's works. It can be seen as a continuation of the great influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on artists not only in his adopted city of Brussels, but throughout the whole of the Low Countries.Ursula was the daughter of the Christian King Dionotus of Dumnonia. At her father's insistence she agreed to marry the pagan Conan Meriadoc of Armorica, but not before a religious pilgrimage to Rome, circa 383, so that her suitor could be baptized. Upon their return from Rome, the couple stopped in Cologne, where they, along with her eleven thousand virgin attendants, were intercepted by the Huns, then in control of the German city. The pagan Hunnish prince asked Ursula to be his bride, but he was rejected. As retribution, Ursula was put to death by arrows, along with her attendants, all of whom were beheaded. Here the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara depicts St. Ursula punctured by a single arrow, her identifying symbol, as she protects her attendants with her finely rendered robe	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Barbara	St Ursula Protecting the Eleven Thousand Virgins with Her Cloak	Oil on panel, 38 x 27 cm	1470-1500	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

05871-chiswic1.jpg	Lord Burlington created the most complex example of Palladian architecture. Chiswick House, built between 1723 and 1729, is close to the villas of the Veneto in Italy. The ground plan, a square containing a central octagon, recalls Palladio's Villa Rotonda. A suite of interconnecting geometric spaces surround the domed central hall; they extend into apses with statues in the niches.The exterior combines multiple references to antiquity. The six Corinthian columns of the portico are from the temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome, the semi-circular, subdivided windows of the drum are reminiscent of Roman thermal baths. These features do not represent a literal quotation from ancient buildings but rather a version of the sixteenth-century interpretations which were accessible to Burlington through Palladio's drawings and buildings	BOYLE, Richard, 3rd Earl of Burlington	Exterior view	Photo	1725-29	other	English	1701-1750

00879-40west.jpg	Sixtus II (257-258) had charged archdeacon Lawrence with dispersing the church's wealth to the needy. This deed aroused the ire of Emperor Valerian who had claimed the treasure for himself, and formed the basis for the charges brought against Lawrence and his eventual execution.In its setting in the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican, the dramatic impact of this fresco is aided by its position between two recessed windows. The scene is set in the nave of a basilica, the type of architectural space which in St Lawrence distributing Alms was used only as a backdrop. Five columns are visible on either side, and they are equalled in volume and monumentality by the bishops and other churchmen who witness St Lawrence kneeling before the Pope. The end wall of the basilica and its niche bring emphasis to no figure in the composition, for none stands at the centre. The central axis runs instead through the communion chalice which passes between the Pope and the saint.It is remarkable that in this fresco cycle the pope and the prelates wear azure vests, then rarely used and presently non-existent	ANGELICO, Fra	St Peter Consacrates St Lawrence as Deacon	Fresco, 271 x 197 cm	1447-49	religious	Italian	1401-1450

It is closely linked  to the atmospheres and colours of ""White Wall with White Furniture"" and ""Flox and Filox"", but the intensity and variety of its colours are in favour of ""When One Lives on One's Memories"".  Its composition is superb: by applying space near and far he expresses the physical and psychic departure of  the old woman, the central figure of the picture, whose relationship to the world is slowly fading. Greyish-blue of the second space are in an intrinsic contrast with the cheerful foreground full of colours, with elements of Rippl's former pictures, e.g. the red of the colourful head kerchief.

06475-01baptis.jpg	"Pieter Bruegel the Elder was the most important figure in sixteenth-century Flemish painting, the founder of a dynasty of painters. His realistic painting of peasants in both his secular and religious works gave him the nickname of ""Peasant Bruegel"". A number of copies of this picture, both contemporary and dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have come down to us, and many of them are in museums in Flanders (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels), as well as in Bonn, Schwerin, Leningrad, Munich and Cracow, mostly produced with the co-operation of his sons, Pieter and Jan, and his workshop employees. This tends to indicate that the picture remained in Brussels for a long time, or was in a collection in another town in the Netherlands which was easily accessible to the public.The numerous copies and variants of this painting with its theme of the Holy Baptism can also be explained by the widespread growth of the Anabaptist movement in those years of religious turbulence and strife. The date of the painting coincides with a period of iconoclasm in the Netherlands.This picture is probably identifiable as that known to have been in the collection of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Governor of the Netherlands, in 1633. In this, the preaching Saint John the Baptist is virtually lost in the colourful throng of peasants, cripples, gipsies, mischievous children climbing trees, and trees painted with astounding realism.

21367-allegory.jpg	Legranée received several royal commissions in a busy life. In the Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin the figures are not strictly allegorical, apart from the sorrowing France behind the bed, for they represent the dauphine and the couple's sons (including the dead one who appears with a crown of stars for his dying father), the effect is of allegory rather than fact. And the idiom in which the picture is painted is certainly classical, much as interpreted by Batoni, though critics of the day it suggested Guido Reni	LAGRENÉE, Louis-Jean-François	Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin	Oil on canvas, 129 x 97 cm	1765	mythological	French	1751-1800

30619-washing.jpg	In the 1880s, Lombardy began to play an active part in Italian art. The movement that originated there declared its loyalty to the great Italian tradition, and was particularly interested in atmospherics of light, colour, and texture. In the 1890s, such work came into its own with divisionist or pointillist paintings.In the work of Pellizza, the most important Lombard Neo-Impressionist, the goals of the leading French pointillist, Seurat, were most consistently pursued. This was apparent not only in his relinquishing romantic natural scenes such as Impressionism favoured, and preferring an art based upon ideas; he also dispensed with clear outlines, and used strong contrasts of juxtaposed colours. His thematic range was great, and included curiously symbolic paintings such as Washing in the Sun	PELLIZZA DA VOLPEDO, Giuseppe	Washing in the Sun	Oil on canvas, 87 x 131 cm	1905	landscape	Italian	1851-1900
11367-5delaroc.jpg	Anglomania was in fashion in France in the 1820s and 1830s. Interest in British history, fuelled by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, was further stimulated by parallels drawn between recent events in France and the turbulent accounts of Tudors, Stuarts and the Civil War. The pictorial representation of British history may have been pioneered in Britain, but it was the Frenchman Paul Delaroche who gained a European reputation with the grand scenes drawn from it which he exhibited at the annual Paris Salon between 1825 and 1835. Popularised through mass-produced engravings, these set pieces, combining ostentatious antiquarianism with the pseudo-realism of bourgeois melodrama, in turn influenced the painters of national history in mid-Victorian Britain.The painting depicts the last moments on 12 February 1554 in the life of the seventeen-year old Jane Grey, a great granddaughter of Henry VII who was proclaimed Queen of England upon the death of young King Edward VI, a Protestant like herself. She reigned for nine days in 1553, but, through the machinations of the partisans of Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor, she was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death in the Tower of London.Delaroche, who based the painting on a sixteenth-century Protestant martyrology, has falsified the historical account the better to appeal to his contemporaries. Lady Jane Grey, a humanist-educated young married woman, was in fact executed out of doors. Attended by two gentlewomen, probably no less stoical than she, she resolutely made her own way to the block. She could not have worn a white satin dress of nineteenth-century cut with a whalebone corset, and her hair would have been tucked up, not streaming down over her shoulders. But a painting cannot be judged by the criteria of historical accuracy. Much more applicable to this particular picture are the standards of popular melodrama and tableau vivant.As on a stage, the heroine gropes her way towards the audience, gently guided by the elderly Constable of the Tower whose massive, dark, male presence acts as a foil to her own. A spotlight trained on her from above complements the dim stage lighting, reflecting from her immaculate dress and the straw which spills over into the front row of the stalls. The emotions of each actor are carefully delineated and distinguished, and we are left in no doubt as to the character of each even of the lady in the background who turns her back on the terrible sight	DELAROCHE, Paul	The Execution of Lady Jane Grey	Oil on canvas, 246 x 297 cm	1833	historical	French	1801-1850

32267-19gather.jpg	It was already apparent to Poussin's contemporaries that the artist had given much thought, in The Israelites Gathering Manna, to the means by which painting could unfold a sequence of events before the eyes of the viewer. The artist combines selected aspects of the biblical story into one scene, so as to illustrate the scale of the Israelites' divine rescue from hunger and misery.This painting can be considered a variation on the Raphael fresco, The School of Athens, in the Vatican. Moses in particular, in his draperies and pointing gesture, directly cites the figure of Plato in Raphael's fresco. Poussin has simply transformed the latter's architectural backdrop into a rock formation and rotated the setting - which in the fresco lies parallel to the pictorial plane - as if on a turntable towards the right, so that it now leads away at a diagonal into the depths	POUSSIN, Nicolas	The Jews Gathering the Manna in the Desert	Oil on canvas, 149 x 200 cm	1637-39	religious	French	1601-1650
28588-paris5.jpg	Flags were flown on 30 June, 1878, to mark the opening of the Great Exhibition. On that day, a sea of flags was fluttering in the wind, and countless people filled the streets. Monet chose a high vantage point in order to emphasize the huge gathering of people. Viewed at close quarters, the milling throng gives the illusion of an ethereal carpet of colour. It is not until one is at a certain distance from the painting that the concrete aspect of the picture comes into focus, and the people on the streets become recognizable as well as the individual flags, which look as though they have been released from the façades of the houses to the left and right	MONET, Claude	Rue Montorgueil in Paris, Celebration of 30 June 1878	Oil on canvas, 81 x 51 cm	1878	historical	French	1851-1900

40992-02jeanbo.jpg	Although no mid-fourteenth century panel painting has come down to us, we can imagine what it may have been like in regarding this portrait of Jean le Bon, which is at the same time the earliest example of portraiture north of the Alps. The painter's brush is used with remarkable assurance, obviously practised in the creation of larger compositions as well. The artist has painted the sitter in profile against a golden background. The very individual character of the face is painted with great realism. A faintly perceptible smile hovers on the lips, the hair is red, the eyes blue. Without the inscription above his head 'Jehan, roi de France', one would hardly imagine it the portrait of a royal personage, a king whose life was full of vicissitudes, ruling during the hardships of the Hundred Years' War	UNKNOWN MASTER, French	Portrait of Jean le Bon, King of France	Wood, 60 x 44 cm	c. 1360	portrait	French	1351-1400
09498-1wedding.jpg	The Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.In this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory	CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM	The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis	Oil on canvas, 246 x 419 cm	1593	mythological	Dutch	1551-1600

15231-4recamie.jpg	This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. David started the portrait of Madame Récamier in 1800 which was never finished. (However, incidentally, this portrait helped a contemporary item of furniture to become known under her name.) When the master learned that the lady had also commissioned his pupil Gérard to paint her, he is said to have refused any further service.In David's portrait, noble simplicity, expressed by the simple dress and the Spartan decoration, is also eloquent in the open face. This might well appear more to the modern viewer than Gérard's version, which was judged to be more representative and flattering at the time. And comparisons with portraits of Madame Récamier by other artists suggest that Gérard had achieved a better likeness than David. The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.Gérard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation. Her low-cut bodice is seductive, the red curtain flatters the subject and gives the flesh a rosy tint. Where David gave the beautiful woman a rather severe touch around the mouth, Gérard embellishes her features with the hint of a gentle smile, making her look younger. By contrast, David's portrait in the antique manner looks rather forced. Perhaps these were the reasons why his painting was never finished. Madame Récamier gave Gérard's portrait of her to her admirer Prince Augustus of Prussia, a nephew of Frederick II, who had met the French beauty at the salon of Madame de Sta&#235;l. For state reasons a marriage was impossible, but in the painting Madame Récamier was ever present in the palace which Schinkel furnished for the Prince in 1817.After the death of the Prince the portrait was returned to Madame Récamier	GÉRARD, François	Madame Récamier	Oil on canvas, 255 x 145 cm	1805	portrait	French	1801-1850
25137-lucretia.jpg	Dr. Ellen Konowitz has recently reascribed all the panel paintings previously given to Dirck Vellert (who is known through his drawings, prints and stained glass) to the Master of the Lille Adoration, named for a painting in the Musée des Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. As the artistic production of this master continues to be more clearly defined and studied from the technical point of view, it has become evident that some works in the oeuvre of Jan Gossart most likely belong to this group as well: the Holy Family in Saint Louis, the Lucretia in a private collection, and the Portrait of a Man in Hamilton.This master was influenced in part by Gossart's works in the 1520s but never entirely abandoned his attachment to Antwerp Mannerism	MASTER of the Lille Adoration	Lucretia	Oil on panel, 46 x 37 cm	c. 1520-25	historical	Flemish	1501-1550

18921-21pardon.jpg	Guérin's Napoleon Pardoning the Rebels at Cairo has a grain of truth, since Napoleon had shown clemency to the Mamluk leaders of the 1798 rising - but only after the slaughter of most of the insurgents. Guérin burnishes Napoleon's myth subtly, placing his hero to the rear and rather dwarfed by those he has pardoned, in a sort of inverted modesty. If the rebels are allowed dignity in defeat, it is to emphasize the magnanimity of the victor.

09138-diane.jpg	Only two signed paintings by François Clouet are known to exist, of which this, generally regarded as one of the great masterpieces of the French Renaissance art, is one. The subject, shown seated in her bath, traditionally was believed to be the famous beauty, Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566), a favourite of Henry II and virtual ruler of France. However, this identification is now rejected, and the dating, placed either in the 1550s or around 1571 is debated. Diane do Poitiers. Other candidates for the identity of the sitter are Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) and Marie Touchet, mistress to Charles IX.This is the classic portrayal of a Royal mistress in her official role, cool, beautiful, aloof, bejewelled even in her bath, accompanied by the strappings of her state: fine rooms, a noble child in the arms of its leering, accomplice-nurse, the sly Love-child stealing the fruits, the flower of passion in her hand.Regarding the several influences, Titian's influence has been cited. The motif of the servant in the background performing a domestic chore is seen as deriving from the Venus of Urbino. The painting also shows affinities to the highly polished surfaces and icy eroticism of Bronzino. The pose of the woman in the bathtub was derived from a composition by Leonardo, known as the Monna Vanna (now lost	CLOUET, François	A Lady in Her Bath	Oil on wood, 92 x 81 cm	c. 1571	portrait	French	1551-1600

30955-belisari.jpg	The theme of Belisarius was much in vogue from the 1770s, and in addition to Jacques-Louis David, rival artists of David's own generation, such as Pierre Peyron and François-André Vincent, had painted their own versions of the subject. In Peyron's work, Belisarius is recognized by a peasant who had served under him, and praised as their protector and saviour by the rural family that now give him hospitality	PEYRON, Jean-François-Pierre	Belisarius Receiving Hospitality from a Peasant Who Had Served under Him	Oil on canvas, 93 x 132 cm	1779	historical	French	1751-1800
40383-2quarat1.jpg	"The predella, today in the Museo Arcivescovile in Florence, belonged to an altarpiece that has been lost (but was originally painted for the church of San Bartolomeo at Quarate). It is stylistically close to the Prato frescoes, and it consists of three scenes: St John on Patmos, the Adoration of the Magi and Saints John and Ansano.Although some scholars do not believe it is the work of Uccello, it can be placed chronologically in the group of paintings accepted as Uccello's work. As certain critics have pointed out, the Quarate predella shows the same interest in narrative, lively colours and description of details which is typical of Uccello's production in the years when he was working on the Prato frescoes (1435-40). A feeling of abstraction pervades these scenes, today no more than a group of fragments of faded and almost undecipherable images, in which we can make out a few architectural structures shown in accurate perspective and some monks laid out according to geometric patterns. In the extravagant choice of colours Uccello appears to have given his fantasy free rein; in fact, as Vasari noted, ""he did not pay much attention to the rule of consistency in colour, as was usual in the painting of stories; for he made the fields blue, the cities red, and the buildings the colour he felt like."

Armed with a cross, she pierced its belly and split the monster open, allowing her to walk free.

15483-0chapel.jpg	"""... He did a chapel in Santissima Trinita for Francesco Sassetti with stories of St Francis, an admirable work, remarkable for its grace, finish and delicacy"" (Vasari).Francesco Sassetti had gained his wealth as a partner in the French branches of the Medici bank in Avignon and Lyon. He also spent over ten years representing the Medici bank in Genoa and occasionally in Geneva. But he was not always successful later on in his role as the chairman of the bank, and in 1484 was replaced by Giovanni Tornabuoni. By the end of the 1470s, Sassetti had already acquired the rights of patronage to a small side chapel, the second to the right of the choir in the Florentine church of Santissima Trinita. It was probable at this time that Ghirlandaio was commissioned to paint the chapel, which he decorated with frescoes between 1482 and 1485.The donor and his wife had themselves portrayed as life-sized figures kneeling in prayer at the side of the altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds. The donors are adoring the Christ Child, just like the shepherds in the panel painting. An incomplete inscription under their portraits names the day on which the chapel was consecrated, 25 December 1485, hence also the date by which it would have been completed. This year corresponds with the complete inscription on the altarpiece. In the Sassetti Chapel the artist combined secular, religious, and classical themes to produce a unique masterpiece.In the scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of contemporaries and views of Florence: he recreated religious events to the Florence of his day. In contrast to the newly built Saint Fina Chapel, the Sassetti Chapel was old and in the Gothic style. On each of its three walls Ghirlandaio painted two scenes from the life of Saint Francis, completed by a seventh fresco in the tympanum over the arched entrance to the chapel. At the crown of the entrance arch, the Sassetti coat of arms is surrounded by a garland of fruit, a sculptural work made of terracotta. The fresco in the tympanum above shows a sibyl prophesying Christ's dominion over the world to Emperor Augustus. The fresco idealizes the classical period as the precursor to the Christian age, and this provides a link with the chapel's high point, the altarpiece, which depicts the birth of Christ. The grisaille figure of David outside the chapel can also be interpreted in this way.On the two side walls of the chapel are the black marble sarcophagi of Francesco Sassetti and his wife Nera Corsi, set into niches with round arches. Here the sculptural decorations are dominated by classical motifs; the sculptor Giuliano da Sangallo is sometimes identified as the artist. The tomb niches are framed by grisaille frescoes, in which Ghirlandaio cites motifs from classical coins. Above each are two monumental frescoes by Ghirlandaio, which clearly owe a debt to traditional images. There are still echoes of the pictorial order established by Giotto in Assisi over 160 years earlier. Ghirlandaio studied Giotto's frescoes in the Bardi Chapel, dating from about 1325, in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence, and made direct use of them"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	View of the Sassetti Chapel	Fresco	1483-85	interior	Italian	1451-1500
05439-110madon.jpg	This painting shows the synthesis of trends that formed the style of Botticelli's painting. The composition of the painting resembles Lippi's art, but the figures are more delicately blended into the painting and their expressions and poses are more complicated.Behind the monumental, very sculptural figures is a broad, hilly landscape with a river. The boy-like angel appears to have just this moment stepped through the gap in the wall and come up to Mary and the child; he is presenting them with a bowl decorated with ears of grain and full of grapes. The Christ Child is blessing the gifts, which symbolize the bread and wine of the Eucharist.

22942-09ridott.jpg	"Pietro Longhi was first a pupil of Balestra and then of Crespi whose art was the source of his realism, which expressed a sober and sincere inner world, and a delight in detailed and fresh narrative. He conveyed his realism with wit and ease, whereas the immediacy with which he approached the landscape enriched his painting with a unique quality. Up to a certain point these elements can be discerned in pre-revolution French painting (Watteau, Chardin, Boucher and Lancret), whose influence also made itself felt in Pietro Longhi's realism. Only here and there did grotesque features appear in his art; he saw his figures with the eye of a sage and a gentle and witty impertinence is to be found in many of the scenes he depicted.Pietro Longhi became, by means of his genre-painting, one of the most faithful chroniclers of his age, and one who conjured up a regrettably vanished civilization. It should be borne in mind, however, that his connection with Goldoni and the teachings of Emilia encouraged him, through the observation of reality, to perform a kind of analysis of ""social depths""; he did not want to cause an upheaval but only wanted to point out &#151; perhaps tendentiously &#151; the ineptitude of a declining class of society. Although he did not pass sentence, he allowed his opinion to be known, being fully aware that changes were imminent. Sometimes he would ironically represent certain dandies, abbots and virgins"	LONGHI, Pietro	Il Ridotto	Oil on canvas	1740s	genre	Italian	1701-1750
14977-tahiti23.jpg	In 1889 Gauguin had painted a pair of works entitled Women Bathing (Life and Death) and Woman in the Waves (Ondine). The latter (in the Cleveland Museum of Art) depicts a naked woman, seen from behind, cast adrift in the waves, and in Fatata te miti he has reused the same subject, setting her within a Tahitian genre scene. In Ondine, Gauguin had treated the myth of the water-sprite who can only become human after having a child fathered by a man. Once again, he has explored the theme of the joy of sexual union as an essentially liberating activity, hinted at in the alternative title for The Loss of Virginity: The Awakening of Spring. In Fatata te miti the sexual abandonment is seen as part of the natural rhythm of Polynesian life (the two women do not appear perturbed at the presence of the fisherman in the background of the work), a notion that was integral to the highly popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read before visiting Tahiti and which was calculated to appeal to a Parisian audience	GAUGUIN, Paul	By the Sea (Fatata te Miti)	Oil on canvas, 68 x 92 cm	1892	landscape	French	1851-1900
38903-00bagli1.jpg	The frescoes decorating the main hall of the villa in Massanzago in the Province of Padua were attributed until the 1980s to various eighteenth-century painters, such as Jacopo Guarana, Giovanni Battista Crosato or Giambattista Pittoni. However, it turned out that the frescoes are the early works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Obvious stylistic and iconographic similarities between these frescoes and other early Tiepolo works were pointed out.The work at the Villa Baglioni began immediately after the wealthy Venetian publisher Giambattista Baglioni acquired in 1718 the seventeenth-century villa in Massanzago. The frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main hall, illusionistically breaking through the walls and creating a boundless space, thanks to the faux architectural structure conceived by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, who henceforth would be Tiepolo's most frequent collaborator, working on almost all of his large-scale decorative projects in Venice and the Veneto.The theme of the frescoes is the Myth of Phaethon, based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. The principal episode, Phaethon Asking His Father to Let Him Drive the Chariot of Sun, is staged on the east wall. The opposite wall is divided into two parts by the doors that lead into the hall from the monumental staircase. The right portion of the wall contains the Fall of Phaethon, the left part shows the Heliads, sisters of Phaethon.

37103-1apostl2.jpg	The individual apostles cannot be identified with the exception of Peter and John, who stand in the panel to the left of the Christ-Thomas grouping. The idea of presenting pairs of apostles in debate is borrowed from the bronze doors that Donatello created for the Old Sacristy at San Lorenzo, Florence. Signorelli borrowed not only some of the compositional features of Donatello's reliefs but also specific iconographic details. Like Donatello, he depicts his apostles barefoot and draped in classical garments, eschewing any identifying attributes and even halos	SIGNORELLI, Luca	Pair of Apostles in Dispute	Fresco, 238 x 200 cm	1477-82	religious	Italian	1451-1500

09037-12sylvia.jpg	Claude's very last picture, the Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia is one of Claude's purest inspirations from the poetry of Virgil.In the painting the yellows have faded completely, leaving a bluish tinge over the whole, and the entire surface has been abraded. As a result the picture has an unnatural and ghostly feeling. The composition is one of Claude's most calculated, with trees, distant landscape and figures in total harmony. The Deruet-like figures are more.prominent than usual, with their bright blues and reds. The story is a tragic one: Ascanius accidentally shoots the stag of Sylvia, which unleashes a brutal war of revenge. It is fitting that Claude should have ended his career on this theme without depicting brutality, as it sums up his gentleness of temperament as an artist.The painting was executed for the Principe Colonna and was still in the collection in 1783	CLAUDE LORRAIN	Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia	Oil on canvas, 120 x 150 cm	1682	landscape	French	1651-1700

07586-53mercy0.jpg	From the fiefs of the Colonna family Caravaggio took refuge in Naples, in 1606. There he began to work again with his usual, astounding speed. Early in January 1607 he was paid for the immense altarpiece commissioned to him by the Pio Monte di Misericordia (where it may still be seen today). The painting shows the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is very complicated in its organization. Caravaggio actually had to add a series of figures (two angels and the Madonna and Child, the latter painted later) in the upper part of the painting, which make the composition of the picture the most complex, perhaps, in any of his works. Caravaggio did not paint exemplary episodes intended to stir the viewer to religious piety through the illustrative emphasis of gestures and feelings. Rather, he entrusted the educational effectiveness of his works to the evidence of things in themselves, in the conviction that nothing should be added above and beyond what is already contained in the intrinsic eloquence of the various poses.The seven acts of mercy represented on the painting are the following. On the right appear the (1) burial of the dead and the episode of the so-called Carita Romana (Cimon's daughter giving her father suck in prison), which contains at once the two charitable acts of (2) visiting prisoners and (3) feeding the hungry. (4) Dressing the naked appears in the foreground, symbolized by St. Martin and the beggar. Next to this scene, the host and St. James of Compostela allude to the (5) offering of hospitality to pilgrims. (6) Relieving the thirsty is represented by Samson drinking from the ox jaw. The youth on the ground behind the beggar of St. Martin may also represent the merciful gesture of (7) caring for the sick.We readily apprehend the artist's power of synthesis, which concentrates a conceptual content that is potentially quite dispersive, in the model behavior of a few figures. The large painting was widely copied and studied by seventeenth-century Neapolitan painters, who drew ideas and formal devices from it	CARAVAGGIO	The Seven Acts of Mercy	Oil on canvas, 390 x 260 cm	c. 1607	religious	Italian	1551-1600

29969-winter_s.jpg	Isack van Ostade was the short-lived younger brother of the painter of scenes from peasant life, Adriaen van Ostade. They were both born, lived and worked in Haarlem, and Isack was a pupil of his brother who was eleven years his senior. Isack joined the guild in 1643. His earliest paintings - the first dated picture is from 1639 - are peasant interiors dependent on Adriaen's, but towards the end of his brief career he became more interested in outdoor scenes and produced a series of beautiful and original landscapes, often set in winter. This deliberately picturesque view, its low viewpoint serving to outline the wooden bridge against the sky, is one of his finest paintings. It is rich in its treatment of the details of peasant life, whose harsh aspects (as seen, for example, in the figure of the man labouring under his load of faggots) are relieved by the pleasure taken by the child in the anticipation of skating on the frozen river.

But she soon alleviated his lot by making him her lover. While in her service he grew effeminate, wearing women's clothes and adornments, and spinning yarn.

In her right hand the lady holds a single pink rosebud; her left arm rests gracefully on a stone balustrade.The painting is a betrothal or marriage portrait and in 1773 had a pendant, a portrait of a man with a statue of Mercury	SLINGELAND, Pieter Cornelisz. van	Portrait of a Lady Holding a Rose	Oil on panel, 20 x 17 cm	1670s	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700
41169-x_sebast.jpg	This panel was one of the side wing of an altar triptych which the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder produced for the Bishop of Eichst&#228;tt. The local patron saints Willibald and Walburga, adored by the bishop, occupied the central panel, which is now in the Historical Museum in Bamberg. The side wings with Sts Sebastian and Roch on the inner sides are still in the possession of the diocese.The representation of St Sebastian does not follow the pictorial tradition, he is only recognisable in the general iconographic context and from the arrow, his attribute, which he holds in his hands. His contemporary dress and facial features suggest a portrait of Count Philipp of Solms-Lich as a historiated portrait.

21482-eremiti1.jpg	Shortly after the completion of the ceiling in the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese, Annibale and his pupils, who included Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco, were asked to provide decorations for a palazzetto behind Palazzo Farnese, across the Via Giulia. The decoration consisted of mainly landscapes. In keeping with the character of the building, a casino in a garden, they represented mythological episodes. A few years later, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese decided to add a small room (Camerino degli Eremiti) to the Palazzetto Farnese as a Christian retreat where he could withdraw for his devotion. Giovanni Lanfranco was responsible for its entire decoration which consisted of four large frescoes, and nine ceiling panels, only two of which survived, Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels and Christ Served by Angels	LANFRANCO, Giovanni	Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels	Oil on canvas, 109 x 78 cm	c. 1616	religious	Italian	1601-1650
11201-1880s_20.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	Woman Combing Her Hair	Pastel on paper on cardboard, 87 x 57 cm	1887-90	genre	French	1851-1900
24868-madonna1.jpg	Although in the 1440s Filippo Lippi explored a variety of solutions for showing the Madonna and Child within or against an architectural niche, with the Child resting on a parapet - the finest example is that in Washington - in none of these is there a similar illusionistic intent, with the parapet and tabernacle window conceived as though projecting into the viewer's space. The point of reference for the author of this painting was certainly Donatello' Pazzi Madonna.The artist of this picture certainly spent time in the workshop of Filippo Lippi: the spherical heads and curiously boneless hands relate to Lippi's works of the late 1430s - especially the Tarquinia Madonna and the Barbadori Altarpiece	MASTER of Pratovecchio	Madonna and Child	Tempera on wood, 99 x 70 cm	1440s	religious	Italian	1451-1500
23627-refector.jpg	The Genoese Alessandro Magnasco was taught by his father Stefano and a little known Milanese painter, Filippo Abbiati, and began by painting in a conventional seventeenth-century style. During his stay in Florence at the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, he became acquainted with the work of Salvator Rosa and the etchings of Callot, and under their influence developed a content and style of his own. His themes were bizarre, different from anything to be seen in Genoa, Milan, or indeed anywhere in Italy; nor did his manner of painting resemble that of any other artist in Italy. He depicted imaginary scenes, capriccios in many of which monks are seen in strange settings or tiny figures in stormy landscapes. In his paintings, which are usually small, the figures are oddly elongated, the strokes of the brush vibrating and restless; indeed, everything seems to be in flickering movement.The number of people depicted in this painting and the richness of the decorations lead us to think that this may have been the General Chapter of the Franciscan Order	MAGNASCO, Alessandro	The Observant Friars in the Refectory	Oil on canvas, 176 x 143 cm	c. 1740	religious	Italian	1701-1750
07880-1camerin.jpg	The Villa Caldogno is the result of one of Palladio's early projects. Its construction began in 1542, at the behest of Losco Caldogno, an aristocrat and silk merchant from Vicenza, who had inherited an agricultural complex and fields in Caldogno the year before. Construction of the building and the decoration of the interiors extended over a long period of time, brought to completion only in 1570.The fresco decoration of the loggia, the Central Hall, and two other rooms (Room of Scipio and Room of Sofonisba) was completed by Giovanni Antonio Fasolo and Giovanni Battista Zelotti by 1570. In 1646, the interior distribution of the space was modified and a new small room (camerino), connecting the Room of Scipio and the Room of Sofonisba, was frescoed by the young Venetian painter Giulio Carpioni. These frescoes illustrate scenes from Guarino Guarini's Pastor Fido (The Faithful Shepherd). The room was partly frescoed earlier by an unidentified sixteenth-century painter with some episodes taken from Torquato Tasso's Aminta.Carpioni's paintings in the camerino unfold in three compartments on the walls, each containing an episode from the poem; the compartments are embellished along the side edges with refined, colourful floral festoons. The scenes depict: The Coronation of the Nymph Amaryllis, Winner of the Kissing Competition; The Pursuit of Corsica by a Satyr; and the Wounding of Dorinda, Mistaken by the Shepherd Silvio for One of His Prey. In the corners of the room, as a connective element, are two unusual, extremely lively candelabra.

34926-07gartem.jpg	The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. When establishing the narrative composition, priority was given to the arrangement of narrative events rather than to the continuous narrative flow. Thus, popular subjects, such as Noah's Ark, were made to stand out in spectacular fashion.As was common in the Middle Ages, the artist who created this picture showed the ark as a lateral elevation. Judging by its hull, the ark is a Viking ship with a stem fortified by monsters, and a three-story superstructure and small wheel-house just as described in the Bible. Animals look out through the round-arched windows, and Noah's family crouch above	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French	Noah's Ark	Fresco	c. 1100	religious	French	1051-1100

07775-60meetin.jpg	"Canvas No. 6 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The same colour tone and mood as in the Apotheosis, but used in a much more self-assured perspective composition, appears again in the Meeting between Pope Cyriacus and the Pilgrims. Scholars do not agree on the dating of this canvas and suggestions go from 1491, the same year as the Apotheosis of St Ursula, to 1493, the year of the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula. Even the question of the identification of the character in red standing next to Pope Cyriacus as Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Humanist and the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1493 after having fallen out of grace in Venice, is used in different ways by the advocates of the various chronological theories. The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490.The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls"	CARPACCIO, Vittore	The Pilgrims Meet the Pope	Tempera on canvas, 281 x 307 cm	c. 1492	religious	Italian	1501-1550

His best-known work is the life-size Young Bull, an unusual heroization of a single animal, a counterpart to the monumental trend of Ruisdael and Cuyp.Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages. The ancient Greek painter Zeuxis used a similar method; when he painted his portrait of Helen in the city of Croton he chose five beautiful virgins, in order to copy the finest features of each, for in one woman he felt he could not find perfect beauty.What makes this painting so special is the fact that Potter painted something as ordinary as a bull on such a grand scale - which had never been done before. And despite this large size, he paid great attention to the smallest details.During the nineteenth century the Young Bull by the twenty-two-year-old Potter ranked close in fame to the Night Watch of Rembrandt. Later generations have been less captivated by Potter's fidelity to nature when he worked life-size. Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless. Atmosphere enters the picture only in the lovely distant view on the right, where a sunny light plays upon the cattle in the meadows and on the woods, making this passage one of his loveliest landscapes. Potter is more consistent on a small scale, and his cabinet pieces show him at his best.	POTTER, Paulus	The Young Bull	Oil on canvas, 236 x 339 cm	1647	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
13632-09ferenc.jpg	According to the Bible, the older brothers who were jealous of their father's love sell Joseph to the Ishmailites (Book IV of the Old Testament). The picture  shows the most tragic scene of the betrayal. Joseph, stripped to the waist, is seized and led to the merchants in white burnous who have just arrived. Ferenczy's picture, which is the largest of all in size, opens prospects: in the background of the scene  there is a huge plain area with figures lining up in the foreground. It is not necessary to know the biblical story to understand what is going on. The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background. The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.The picture was painted from beginning to end in the open air, as it is known from Valér's letter to his father, the size of the picture must have presented a lot of technical problems.

17802-706goya.jpg	Like many other uncommissioned works, the subject of this painting has been interpreted in various ways and it has borne several descriptive titles. The woman reading the letter has been thought to be a portrait. One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'. It has also been suggested that Goya intended this painting as a pendant to Time and the Old Women. The two canvases are almost exactly the same size, were acquired for the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille, at the same time and have the same provenance. But there seems to be no obvious connection between the subjects of the two paintings and Time and the Old Women, which is known to have been in Goya's possession in 1812, is almost certainly a slightly earlier work. There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings. But the composition is less contrived and, as in many other works, chiefly the uncommissioned ones, it appears to be based on a scene that the artist had witnessed and recorded on the spot or from memory. This was one of four paintings by Goya in the collection of King Louis Philippe which had been obtained in Madrid from Goya's son	GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de	Les Jeunes or the Young Ones	Oil on canvas, 181 x 122 cm	1812-14	other	Spanish	1801-1850
24478-portrait.jpg	The painting is in a poor state of conservation, the colours have altered dramatically. However, the portrait has an extraordinary presence. The face, defined by its sharp contour, is modeled like sculpture. The three-dimensional effect of the mazzocchio (the turban) is emphasized by being cut at the right edge of the picture. The portrait can be compared with various portraits by Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, especially the bystanders in the scene of St Peter preaching. This comparison points to a date about 1426-27, making this panel the earliest surviving independent portrait in fifteenth-century Florence	MASACCIO	Profile of a Man	Tempera on wood, 41 x 30 cm	1426-27	portrait	Italian	1401-1450
38264-maurice.jpg	St Maurice is a legendary warrior saint, the commander of the 'Theban Legion', Roman troops from Thebes in Egypt, who served at Agaunum in Gaul (St-Maurice en Valais) in the 3rd century. He is dressed in medieval armour. The story, whose authenticity is debated, relates that the soldiers, at the instigation of Maurice, refused to participate in certain pagan rites. They were punished by the Emperor Maximian Herculeus first by decimation and finally by the wholesale massacre of the legion. Maurice and his fellow officers were executed in A.D. 287.According to another interpretation, the warrior saint is identified as St Secundus	STROZZI, Bernardo	St Maurice and the Angel	Oil on canvas, 82 x 101 cm	c. 1640	religious	Italian	1601-1650
23922-tavern.jpg	In the 1620s in Roman circles, a definite change came about in the subject matter of musical paintings. The representation of figures playing musical instruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's Lute Player and Musicians) disappeared. Within the space of a very few years they were replaced by large numbers of representations of concerts in public places and 'popular' locations. One of the earlier examples of this new trend is Bartolomeo Manfredi's Tavern Scene with a Lute Player. One characteristic of the painting, besides the presence of the lute player in a non-musical context (he simply accompanies a scene in which people are eating and drinking), is the absence of a musical score, an attribute of 'cultivated' musical painting.

21820-guitar.jpg	In this elegant genre scene, a young woman holding a guitar with her hand tries to play the instrument. The most striking element within the composition is the woman leaning out of the window. Her main role in this painting is to represent the five senses: touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing. Hearing symbolized by the guitar, touch and sight by the butterfly, smell by the perfume of the plant, and taste by the oranges on top of the rock.

17967-06monte1.jpg	"After completing the cycle of St Francis, Benozzo painted the first bay in the monastery church's southern side aisle, known as the Chapel of St Jerome. The main wall shows a painted polyptych, the Madonna and Child surrounded by Saints. This creates the illusion that it continues in the fresco painted above it, as if it were a realistic addition in front of the wall. The curtain and the shadows of the pinnacles and triangular gables make a considerable contribution to creating this impression. Benozzo's artistic capabilities here reached the highest level of illusion. It addition, it is remarkable that the artist ""placed"" the Gothic work within a classical framework which he signed OPUS BENOZII DE FLORENZIA.Above the polyptych Christ on the Cross can be seen surrounded by four angels who are catching the blood dripping from his wounds. On either side below him, St Dominic and St Francis are kneeling on the left side, and St Romuald and St Sylvester on the right. The walls show St Jerome in the desert and the martyrdom of St Sebastian. In the vault the four evangelists appear with their attributes: St Matthew with the angel, St Mark with the lion, St Luke with the ox and St John with the eagle.

18377-1704grec.jpg	There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions. He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition. The version in the Budapest museum is a good example of the vertical type. There are other vertical versions in Andújar, in Cuenca and in Buenos Aires. The intervention of El Greco's workshop can be assumed in all these paintings.In his religious compositions and portraits El Greco frequently repeated themes from his major works, with slight alterations, to meet different commissions. He broke away from the Renaissance tradition and ceased to depict reality and nature. In order to convey mystic emotions and to imbue his work with passion he distorted and elongated the forms and used stridently blazing colours to express the transcendental. The Agony in the Garden is such mystic interpretation representative of El Greco's late years and mature style.The painting depicts the last night of Christ on the Mount of Olives. In the foreground the tired pupils are sleeping, their unnaturally rigid robes refer to the wax models which the aged master used. Above them Christ is kneeling while an angel appears. The scene is a grassy clearing which looks like to be a lighted stage.

14954-tahiti01.jpg	Gauguin's Tahitian paintings celebrate the lushness and mysterious splendour of his new environment. At the same time they are seldom correct pictures of Tahitian life, from an anthropological standpoint, but rather feature recastings and recombinations of objects and persons taken out of their normal settings, as was the case with several of his paintings done in Brittany.The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau). In Ia Orana Maria Gauguin places the Christian story into a setting where both the figures and the vegetation are Polynesian. A Tahitian woman, her young son, and two women standing nearby are shown in the obvious attitudes of the Virgin and Child with attendant saints or worshiping angels.Once again Gauguin has returned to the theme of the effect of profound religious faith on an apparently simple people, which had preoccupied him in some of his most important Breton works. The apparently effortless fusion of Christian iconography with Tahitian subject matter is in fact carefully contrived, with the poses of the background figures lifted from the relief carving on the Javanese temple of Borobudur, photographs of which Gauguin had taken with him to Tahiti	GAUGUIN, Paul	Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary)	Oil on canvas, 114 x 88 cm	1891	religious	French	1851-1900
21307-09magdam.jpg	Around 1620 a group of young French painters developed interesting derivations from works by Caravaggio. Among these we find Georges de la Tour. In his canvases he adopted the strong light and shade contrasts characteristics of Caravaggio's school, although in his chiaroscuro effects he preferred the Nordic tenebrosi's use of artificial light, such as candles and torches, which produces a dazzling effect and creates a more transcendental atmosphere that does not include the supernatural.

04123-peasants.jpg	Nicolaes Berchem, the son of a distinguished still-life painter, Pieter Claesz., was born in Haarlem. The town was a leading centre of landscape painting in the early seventeenth century and among Berchem's teachers was the landscapist Jan van Goyen. Like many Dutch artists, Berchem travelled to Italy immediately after completing his apprenticeship. He was in Rome late in 1642 and remained there for three years. While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes. As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments. These buildings cannot be identified, as they are only loosely modelled on actual ruins. Berchem uses a bright, highly-coloured palette and applies the paint in short, stabbing brush strokes.In seventeenth-century Holland there was a constant demand for exotic landscapes of this type and Berchem was a highly successful artist. He moved to Amsterdam, which had a larger art market than Haarlem, in about 1677. His work was widely imitated and copied during his lifetime and his paintings enthusiastically sought after in France in the eighteenth century and in England in the nineteenth. This painting, having been in the distinguished Amsterdam collection of Gerrit Braamcamp in the mid-eighteenth century, was bought in Paris by the Duc de Chabot in 1780 and in London in 1840 by Sir Robert Peel	BERCHEM, Nicolaes	Peasants with Cattle by a Ruined Aqueduct	Oil on wood, 47 x 39 cm	c. 1658	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

38716-girlhold.jpg	In addition to the paintings by Caravaggio, Terbrugghen was also inspired by Northern imagery from the sixteenth century and by the subject matter and figure style of his contemporary, Dirck van Baburen. The two artists probably shared a studio in Utrecht, and around 1620 both artists produced series of genre scenes with single figures - musicians, singers, smokers and drinkers. These genre scenes were often produced in pairs.Terbrugghen's figures have often been interpreted as allegories of the Five Senses. The present painting has been seen as interpreting Taste. It was only partly executed by Terbrugghen, the painting was completed by another, inferior hand in his workshop	TERBRUGGHEN, Hendrick	Girl Holding a Tankard and a Glass	Oil on canvas, 103 x 84 cm	1626	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
42435-scene1.jpg	Originally this panel formed part of a series of paintings consisting of five consecutive scenes, each accompanied by a saying (Poverty leads to Cunning; Cunning leads to Wealth; Wealth leads to Luxury; Luxury leads to Misery; and Misery leads to Death). Each scene shows two main figures walking, dancing or stumbling through a sketchily rendered landscape. In Poverty leads to Cunning they are two old, blind musicians, the man playing a hurdy-gurdy and the woman a rommelpot. The inscription is written on a curling banderole lying on the ground.These monochrome oil paintings on panel are universally referred to as grisailles although in this case it is actually in shades of brown (brunaille)	VENNE, Adriaen Pietersz. van de	"Armoe' Soeckt List (""Poverty Leads to Cunning"")"	Oil on panel, 37 x 31 cm	1630s	genre	Dutch	1601-1650

38632-bp_advic.jpg	"This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his ""Die Wahlverwandtschaften"" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs. Contrary to Vermeer's paintings, the dim light and the subdued chiaroscuro do not allow a forceful grasp of the whole field of vision. The light comes mostly from the front and stops at the glossy surfaces of the costumes and other textures"	TERBORCH, Gerard	Paternal Admonition (Gallant Conversation)	Oil on canvas, 71 x 73 cm	c. 1654	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

15943-venus.jpg	Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter. The Sleeping Venus is a case in point. The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting. She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature. Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies. Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed. Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world. Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master. In the Sleeping Venus a significant share has been assumed for Titian, especially in the landscape, where on the right a cupid has been painted out. The outstretched figure, stocky in proportions, is usually considered to be by Giorgione. The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface. But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality. Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject. There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed. If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death	GIORGIONE	Sleeping Venus	Oil on canvas, 108 x 175 cm	c. 1510	mythological	Italian	1451-1500
17731-218goya.jpg	The old superstitious, heathen cult of Pan that was persecuted by the Church but which still persisted in the more remote corners of the country was the subject of Goya's attack in this painting. Among a group of fanatic and stupidly credulous women and witches sits a huge ram, demanding one of the children as sacrifice. On the ground lies the emaciated body of a child.

38424-2louis.jpg	Bertalan Székely was the most fastidious master of the style known as historicism. He harboured the idea of painting The Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second already during the years he spent in Transylvania following his studies in Vienna. After having clarified the role of each element of the composition, he painted the great work in 1860 in Munich, where he was studying under Piloty. Working out the structure and the accent of colours in detail was of prime importance for Székely.The last Hungarian king from the Jagello Dynasty, the young Louis II (1516-1526), was slain in the Battle of Mohács. His passing symbolizes the death of the nation and the beginning of the Turkish suzerainty which lasted 150 years. The gestures of respect for the dead as well as the white shroud, which contrast dramatically with the sombre atmosphere, work in unison to focus our attention on the tragic figure of the Hungarian king	SZÉKELY, Bertalan	Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second	Oil on canvas, 140 x 182 cm	1860	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

34948-5oberze4.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the third scene on the north wall: The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. The second scene includes a building on the right with a white wall made of ashlars. The same wall can be seen on the left-hand side of the adjoining scene, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, then suddenly stops. This is where the Sea of Galilee begins. Also visible is the boat which is soon to find itself in a storm. The white ashlar walls must therefore form part of the fortification of the city which reaches down to the harbour	ROMANESQUE PAINTER, German	The Storm on the Sea of Galilee	Fresco	c. 980	religious	German	0951-1000

43957-2luke.jpg	"A sixth-century legend presents Luke as the painter of a number of icons of the Virgin. He is therefore given the status of the painter ""par excellence"", able to capture even the Virgin on canvas. Luke has been the patron of various painters' guilds since the fifteenth century.Depicted in the background of the painting are Mary's parents, Joachim and Anne. The evangelist, who supposedly practiced medicine, is shown dressed like a Flemish doctor; in the Middle Ages he was considered the patron saint of painters, physicians, and apothecaries. It has been suggested that this  is a self-portrait. The way in which Luke holds the stylus resembles the technique artists used to avoid smudging drawings with the heel of the hand.There are a few versions of this painting the most significants being in Boston and Munich"	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	St Luke Drawing a Portrait of the Madonna	Oil on canvas transferred from wood, 103 x 109 cm	-	religious	Flemish	1401-1450
41022-17portra.jpg	This painting has long been associated with the oeuvre of Fragonard, but the attribution and the identity of the sitter have remained uncertain. However, the portrait betrays weaknesses that seem impossible for an artist of Fragonard's abilities. The traditional identification of the sitter as Fragonard's friend and fellow artist Hubert Robert seems also untenable.

The outlines are very sharply defined, and the movement of nerves and tendons observed down to the last detail. Antonio del Pollaiuolo worked at time when thorough studies of anatomy were being made, and he therefore renders the human body realistically in its moments of greatest emotional excitement.The dramatic force of the episode is expressed in the hero's grimace of fatigue and horror, but also his certainty of victory.

23993-6sebasti.jpg	In 15th-century Italian art, portrayals of St Sebastian offered the opportunity of depicting an idealized nude figure in a classical setting. Mantegna tied the saint to the column of a triumphal arch both to emphasize his heroism and at the same time to stress the precise historic setting. The triumphal arch stands in a courtyard closed off by a wall. Debris from statues and a fragment of bacchanalian relief lie around, indicating the fall of the pagans and the victory of Christianity.A bearded horseman can be seen in the cloud to the left. Images in the cloud like this, already described in classical art theory and adopted by Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci, were ascribed to the genius of nature, which could stimulate artists and inspire them to improve on nature with their creations.The vertical inscription at the right side of the saint is the signature of Mantegna in Greek	MANTEGNA, Andrea	St Sebastian	Tempera on wood, 68 x 30 cm	1459	religious	Italian	1451-1500

13143-glorific.jpg	"The cross as the focal point of the ""gloria del paradiso"" is revered by the saints and the elect of the heavenly realm who surround the cross on banks of clouds. On the right, we recognize the patriarchs, including Moses, Abraham and King David. We also see Jonas sitting on the fish, looking up towards the cross, and St Catherine and Mary Magdalene in a sisterly embrace. In the foreground, there is a disputation between St Sebastian and Pope Gregory, St Jerome, St Ambrose and St Augustine, with the first Christian martyrs St Stephen and St Laurence. The cross, clutched by a kneeling female figure who is probably an embodiment of Faith, is surrounded by angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, above which we can make out the Evangelists and Apostles. At the head of a procession of angels streaming into the dazzling light of the background, which is flooded with an overwhelming brightness, we can see the Coronation of the Virgin.Elsheimer's unique art is evident in the astonishing illusion of remarkable breadth and depth achieved by this small panel painting. Here, space is no longer simply a problem of continuously reduced scale, but also one of simultaneous graduation of colour and the distribution of light and darkness. This creates interlocking areas of colour and light which, though perceived by the eye, nevertheless take on the quality of a vision.

The Scenes of the Life of St Benedict in the predella, with their fairy tale charm, are to be reckoned among the highest achievements of the master.Lorenzo's elegant style reached maturity in this very large altarpiece.In this painting the edges of the figures' garments have an animation quite independent of the actual movement of the figures. Although the composition of the painting is quite conventional, the figures display a new fluidity in their poses and in the movements of their drapery which is suggestive of the International Style then being employed in sculpture by Ghiberti and Niccol&#242; Lamberti. Surface patterns vie for attention with the volumes of the figures; even the superimposition of figures tends to read as pattern. Brilliant, light-toned colour and the lavish use of gold and expensive ultramarine blue pigment would have made the painting a strong focal point in the church and would also have testified to its importance and to the donor's extraordinary generosity	LORENZO Monaco	The Coronation of the Virgin	Tempera on wood, 450 x 350 cm	1414	religious	Italian	1401-1450

According to the legend, this likeness appeared in a miraculous way on St Veronica's veil after she had used it to wipe the blood and sweat from the Lord on the Road to Calvary. The vera icon was a favourite subject of paintings and graphic works in the late Middle Ages.The type of image derives from Early Netherlandish painting (Jan van Eyck and Dieric Bouts the Elder)	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Christ's Head with Crown of Thorns	Oil and tempera on limewood, 28 x 21 cm	1520-25	religious	German	1501-1550

04559-yosemite.jpg	Albert Bierstadt, a native of Germany, stood in the tradition of the Hudson River School, founded by the English-born Thomas Cole, which marked the beginning of a genuinely American landscape painting. He discovered the American wilderness for art, applying these means in the tradition of Claude Lorrain. In 1863, Bierstadt and the writer Fritz Hugh Ludlow set off on an expedition to the Wild West, which took them thousands of miles through the dramatic scenery of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, and Oregon. The artist captured these impressions in a series of large-format panoramas that made him the founder of the Rocky Mountain School.Yosemite Valley at Sunset was a preliminary study for one of these large paintings. As dramatic as the area is in reality, Bierstadt heightened it still further, plunging the scene into a veritably mythical illumination. Bierstadt's views and the stereoscopic photographs his two brothers made of the Yosemite Mountains contributed to the declaration of the area as a national park	BIERSTADT, Albert	Yosemite Valley at Sunset	Oil on cardboard, 30 x 49 cm	1864	landscape	American	1851-1900
14560-06macbet.jpg	Fuseli was the second son of the Zurich portraitist and author Johann Caspar Fussli. His early contact with the teachings of Johann Jakob Bodmer familiarized him with the figures of world literature, which were to remain a major source of inspiration throughout his career. Ordained in 1761 as a pastor in the Zwinglian Reformed Church, he left Zurich two years later for political reasons, traveling by way of Berlin to London, where he settled. Initially Fuseli made his living by writing, while engaged in illustrating the works of his favourite authors, particularly William Shakespeare.The painting represents a scene from Shakespeare's Macbeth. It shows Lady Macbeth as a a sleep-walker in the corridor of a fortress. The terrified eyes of Lady Macbeth, by now lost between reality and nightmare, clutch at the viewer, almost as though trying to capture him and carry him off into her own unknown dimension	FUSELI, John Henry	Lady Macbeth	Oil on canvas, 221 x 160 cm	1784	other	Swiss	1751-1800
33484-02histor.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 468.The subject of the painting is debated. Some of the critics thinks it represents Artemisia taking the ashes of Mausolos, while others assume it shows Sophonisba taking the cup of poison. In any cases, it is a representation of matrimonial love therefore it is assumed that the painting depicts Saskia, the wife of the artist.Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory. In Renaissance painting she is depicted holding a cup or goblet	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Artemisia	Oil on canvas, 142 x 152 cm	1634	historical	Dutch	1601-1650
20890-port_you.jpg	Even at the age of eleven, Angelica Kauffmann earned admiring praise for her portrait of Bishop Nevroni and although she would later concentrate on allegorical, antique, historical and religious themes in her paintings, the portrait was to remain the driving force behind her success throughout her life. She received so many commissions that her painting tended to become rather routine, taking on an increasing smoothness and superficial appeal at the expense of a more distinctive style. This Portrait of a Young Woman also has something routine about it, and is as pleasingly decorative as any interior decor that she might have created in her frequent collaboration with the English architect Robert Adam. Nevertheless, it does show a face as that of a highly sensitive personality	KAUFFMANN, Angelica	Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil on canvas, 130 x 102 cm	1781	portrait	Swiss	1751-1800
26106-28jerome.jpg	The legend of this fourth-century doctor of the Church only began to take shape in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting. Small, transparent droplets of blood well up from his bruised chest. His scarlet cardinal's cloak and hat lie on the ground behind him, as if he had just cast them off. The lion lies down faithfully beside him. The scene is enacted on a rocky plateau before a cave, which is the hermit's retreat.This fairly large panel is not very well known, and is sometimes treated with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, it is a fine example in every respect of Memling's vision and technique. Monumentally conceived, yet executed with an undramatically fresh and guileless realism, this St Jerome is one of the most elegant large figures in the artist's oeuvre. The spatial character of the slim, half-naked saint is comparable with the Stuttgart Bathsheba. The extremely free underdrawing, the elongated body shapes and a physiognomy that seems to prefigure that of Van Cleve or Massys suggest that both paintings were executed fairly late, although additional evidence would be required for more precise dating. A characteristic Memling trait is the way the emblematic attributes such as the crucifix, the lion and the cardinal's clothes are included in a natural manner. Taken together, it is like a moment from a story, despite the fact that the depicted elements refer to different periods of the saint's life. Furthermore, the crucifix consists of a genuine flesh-and-blood little body, put to death in miniature, with no attempt on the artist's part to portray it as a vision.We do not know whether the panel was autonomous, or whether it had wings or a companion piece. The small fragment depicting St Jerome and the Lion might have formed part of the left wing (private collection)	MEMLING, Hans	St Jerome	Oil on oak panel, 87,8 x 59,2 cm	1485-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
30937-stillif1.jpg	The drawings of fruits, vegetables and flowers, done in oil on prepared paper, are part of an extraordinary cache of drawings acquired by the Musei Civici of Milan in 1924 from the local church of Santa Maria presso San Celso. They were attributed to the workshop of Simone Peterzano, because many of the drawings in the group are demonstrably by him, and because in subject matter they seemed appropriate to the activity of the workshop. However, the more than two thousand five hundred drawings are enormously varied in style and date. Approximately one thousand have had a traditional association with Peterzano's workshop.

18747-guard213.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself.	GUARDI, Francesco	The Coronation of the Doge	Oil on canvas, 66 x 101 cm	1766-70	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

00370-5battle.jpg	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.

23540-2hunyadi.jpg	"From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, Hungarian painters began to paint historical scenes as well as landscapes, portraits and genre paintings. It was not merely a fashion in Hungary to follow the current Romantic Movement that originated in Paris, or the ""historism"" of the Munich and Vienna Academies; it went much deeper than that. At the defeat of the fight for independence, the nation escaped into its history. Along with Hungarian poets and writers, the painters recalled the glorious events of the past, searching for ideals of patriotism and heroism that had not been crushed by despotism.Viktor Madarász gained the first international appreciation for Hungarian painting when his picture, ""The Bewailing of László Hunyadi"" won the State Grand Prix at the 1861 Paris Salon Exhibition. This rather romantic historical painting of the Hunyadi tragedy epitomizes the national grief of the 1850s, and fans the fire of revenge. The dead body of the heroic László Hunyadi, son of the great János Hunyadi, lies in Buda Castle Chapel. King László V, fearing for throne, had lured the popular young Hunyadi to his place with a promise of safe passage. Then he seized him and had him beheaded in the market place at Buda on March 16, 1457.

14906-early08.jpg	By 1883, and as a direct result of the collapse of the stock market the previous year, Gauguin's finances were in disarray, and he began to consider a change in career. This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.The subject of a snowy landscape was a typical Impressionist device to enable the artist to study the effects of colour reflections on a white surface and was particularly favoured by Sisley. However, the handling in the sky and the foliage is more reminiscent of the work of Monet from this period. The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting. This means that the two women were added later, and demonstrates that even at this date Gauguin did not feel tied to working solely from nature, and had already begun to use the subject of two conversing women which was to recur in his mature work	GAUGUIN, Paul	The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel	Oil on canvas, 117 x 90 cm	1883	landscape	French	1851-1900

41126-2bishop.jpg	This panels belongs to a group of altarpiece fragments with scenes devoted to the life of St Clare. Other panels are in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, and in the Historisches Museum, Bamberg. They are thought to belong to two or more dismembered altarpieces. The painter of the panels was influenced primarily by illuminated manuscripts	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	The Bishop of Assisi, Accompanied by St Francis, Handing a Palm to St Clare	Oil, gold, and silver on oak panel, 34 x 22 cm	c. 1360	religious	German	1351-1400
00195-5verospi.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was the loggia of the Villa Farnesina, painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese, from Reni's Aurora and Guercino's Aurora are also present	ALBANI, Francesco	Ceiling vault of piano nobile loggia	Fresco	1611-12	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

00957-03prede2.jpg	There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The fifth panel of the predella is lost. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes	ANGELICO, Fra	The Naming of St John the Baptist	Tempera and gold on panel, 26 x 24 cm	1434-35	religious	Italian	1401-1450
25051-double1.jpg	This double-sided panel once formed the wing of a now lost altarpiece, with the Adoration of the Magi originally serving as the interior panel and the Throne of Grace as the exterior. Formerly, the panel was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The style of this master and his workshop was greatly influenced by Flemish painters, in particular, Hugo van der Goes, whose Monforte Altarpiece may be seen as a direct inspiration for the individual figures in this work (particularly the second kneeling King in the Adoration). Furthermore, the picture is indicative of the influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on the group of Cologne painters working at the turn of the 16th century. Such influence on the present work can be seen in Rogier's Columba Altarpiece, which utilizes a similar spatial construction and figural arrangement found in the Adoration here	MASTER of the Holy Kinship	The Adoration of the Magi	Oil on panel, 116 x 86 cm	1510s	religious	German	1501-1550

26143-37frag1.jpg	A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm	MEMLING, Hans	Donor	Oil on oak panel, 45 x 32 cm	c. 1490	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

19818-portrai1.jpg	The two panels in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, representing the portraits of a man and a woman, reveal the artist's interest in depicting the physical characteristics of his sitters, both of whom have rather pronounced features. Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife. However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned. It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses	HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder	Portrait of a Woman	Oil on panel, 24 x 17 cm	1518-20	portrait	German	1451-1500
23076-3washin.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church.In this scene the painter makes skillful use of the obstacle represented by the arch on the wall to produce a scene split into two levels. The lively dialog between Christ and the apostle conveys a sense of movement that embrace all the other figures	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Washing of the Feet	Fresco	c. 1320	religious	Italian	1301-1350
41411-18chape1.jpg	The two frescoes (Crucifixion and The Virgin and Donor) from the oratory of Mocchirolo constitute one of the most interesting and complete examples of the spreading influence of Tuscan art in northern Italy during the late fourteenth century. Count Porro, who commissioned the decoration of the oratory, is shown kneeling before the Madonna in The Virgin and Donor. Controlled and contained in feeling, the dramatic aspects of the tragedy of the Crucifixion are expressed in the noble pathos of the swooning Madonna. To maintain the equilibrium of the composition, the outward movement of her body is countered by the angels in flight and the columnar figure of St John.The modeling of the figures, achieved through gradations of intense colour, complements the measured narrative rhythm. In the portraits of the donors (members of the Porro family) on the walls, and in the figure of St Catherine, the drawing is light and precise. In both paintings the roseate colour is laid on in thin, transparent brushstrokes, and the tenuous compositional connections have an elegant subtlety	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Crucifixion	Detached fresco, 378 x 277 cm	1370	religious	Italian	1351-1400

26248-magdalen.jpg	Anton Raphael Mengs painted this picture in 1752 in Rome, and it led to his admittance to the Accademia di San Luca. Later he tackled the subject on numerous occasions, and in very different ways. In this version elegance and an expression of great sensitivity are combined with reminiscences of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century painting, along with echoes of Classicism in the drapery and the landscape.The depiction of Mary Magdalene as a penitent does not appear in the Bible. It was not until the twelfth century that the legend arose of how she withdrew to a cave in Sainte-Baume in Provence in order to do penance after a life of sin	MENGS, Anton Raphael	The Penitent Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 48 x 64 cm	1752	religious	German	1751-1800
32083-underbru.jpg	Along with Giuseppe Recco and Giovan Battista Ruoppolo, Paolo Porpora was one of the leading figures in Neapolitan still-life painting during the Baroque. In his first period in Naples he painted fish and kitchen still-lifes in great variety. In the late 1640s he moved to Rome and, after coming into contact with the Northern European masters Matthias Withoos and Otto Marseus van Schrieck, active in the city at that time, he began to produce his famous underbrush paintings. The painting in Nancy is one of the few examples of these works that remained	PORPORA, Paolo	Underbrush with Tortoise and Crab	Oil on canvas, 61 x 76 cm	1650-55	portrait	Italian	1651-1700
19902-01henry8.jpg	Henry VIII (1491-1547), king of England (1509-47), who presided over the beginnings of the English Renaissance and the English Reformation. His six wives were, successively, Catherine of Aragon (the mother of the future queen Mary I), Anne Boleyn (the mother of the future queen Elizabeth I), Jane Seymour (the mother of Henry's successor, Edward VI), Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr.This portrait is the only surviving individual portrait of Henry that Holbein himself painted. In terms of features, it corresponds largely to the figure in the Whitehall cartoon. Both portraits are likely to have been based on a single, now lost portrait study by Holbein. However, as a consequence of the small format of the panel painting, the heavy shoulder chain that the king wears in the monumental portrait is omitted here, and his sleeves are embroidered with a very delicate gold thread.This is the quintessential image of the overbearing and tyrannous monarch, from the year the dissolution of the monasteries (and the consequent appropriation of their wealth for the Crown and its servants) was instigated. Holbein depicts the King at `face value', without flattery, emphasizing the small, humourless eyes and mouth, the curiously flat cheeks and chin. Henry's bulky and capricious authority haunts the work despite its small size. Its condensation of magnificence run riot here takes the form of real gold used in the chain, jewellery and collar.The portrait is undoubtedly a tour de force; after its execution, Holbein's position at the court seems to have been secure, and he was used as a painter-ambassador when the King's marital plans unraveled in the late 1530s. Only his misleading portrayal of Anne of Cleves would check his popularity.The subsequent spawning of similar but less effective portraits of the king by Holbein's followers has tended to obscure the compelling mixture of simplicity and realism displayed in this design - the tilt and curve of the black and white hat, the fearful symmetry of the jewelled jacket and the modelling of the hands: imitators often managed either simplicity or realism but never both.

37795-3east1.jpg	The picture shows two scenes in the upper register of the east wall. Scene 7 (left) depicts when St Benedict departs the monastery of Vicovaro. Benedict explains to the monks that his way of life is not compatible with theirs, and he leaves them to return to Subiaco.Scene 8 (right) depicts when St Benedict accepts Maurus and Placidus as disciples. More and more followers gather around Benedict and he is soon able to establish twelve monasteries, but also to keep disciples with him for better instruction in the spiritual life.

03287-1assunta.jpg	Around 1475, Bartolomeo della Gatta painted this picture for the Benedictine Church of the Contesse in Cortona. It can be considered his masterpiece because it reaches a degree of lyricism only achieved previously by Piero della Francesca.The painting was moved into the Church of St Dominic in 1788 where the Servants of Mary, who used to run the church, repainted the two Benedictine saints in the foreground, St Benedict and St Scolastica, transforming them into Filippo Benizzi and Giuliana Falconeri, two saints of their religious order. recent restoration has returned the painting to its original beauty and has also removed a group of angels added in the eighteenth century	BARTOLOMEO DELLA GATTA	The Lady of the Assumption Gives St Thomas Her Belt	Tempera on panel, 317 x 221 cm	c. 1475	religious	Italian	1451-1500

17299-selfpo26.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 522, JH 1356.Shortly before he left Paris and moved to Provence in late February 1888, van Gogh painted this final self-portrait. He is no longer dressed as the urban dandy, but in the blue blouson of the Parisian working class. He stands before his easel, holding his palette in a pose intentionally reminiscent of a self-portrait by Rembrandt which was then in the Louvre and well known to van Gogh. Perhaps the painting should be read as a kind of manifesto of the new orientation in his conception of himself as an artist and of his work - the intention to remove himself from the city and its bourgeois lifestyle, and the desire to be seen in a Dutch rather than a French tradition. The painting also betrays a growing confidence in himself as an artist: he appears with the insignia of his profession. Greater assurance is also evident in the handling. The earlier extreme experimentation with pure or broken colour and a textured and structuring brushwork has given way to a more controlled and coherent treatment. In the pose he has used, van Gogh evokes Rembrandt; but the painterly treatment and coloration remind us of another seventeenth-century Dutch artist - Frans Hals. The lessons van Gogh had learnt in Antwerp, explored in greater depth throughout the Paris period, are now successfully integrated into his work to produce a distinctive style	GOGH, Vincent van	Self-Portrait in front of the Easel	Oil on canvas, 65 x 51 cm	January 1888, Paris	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
24767-c_thief.jpg	In his Nativity the Master of Flémalle (Robert Campin) proved himself a sensitive painter of landscape, who knew how to portray the atmospheric subtleties of light and air; but he does not always use nature as the background for his compositions. In the Crucified Thief, the one surviving panel of a lost altarpiece, he resorts to the archaic device of a gold background, contrasting its abstraction with the marked individuality of the figures. The thief's face is contorted with pain, and the wounds where the cords have cut into the flesh are rendered in an extraordinarily brutal manner. The Roman soldiers looking on, particularly the one whose curly hair is held back by a white band and who is placing one hand on his heart, are portrayed with a realism that was at that time outstanding	MASTER of Flémalle	The Crucified Thief	Oil on wood, 33 x 92,5 cm	c. 1410	religious	Flemish	1401-1450
23811-4olympi1.jpg	This canvas was the most vociferously decried painting of the 1865 Salon. In fact, Manet has painted it in 1863 but had apparently not dared submit it in 1864. Olympia is another painting packed with allusions to past masterpieces, notably Titian's Venus of Urbino and Goya's Naked Maja. This whole tradition, from the odalisque to the black slave, continues (particularly with Ingres) throughout the nineteenth century, but what was surprising here was the absence of any exoticism, of either period or location, and the portrayal of a modern prostitute.The painting of the period was not at all averse to flowers, and Courbet, Fantin-Latour, and Manet all painted many pictures with flowers in them. Among the best known bunches (this time wrapped in florist's paper, like those that later Degas placed in the hands of his dancers as they took their bow) is the one being presented by a black servant to Olympia	MANET, Edouard	Olympia	Oil on canvas, 131 x 190 cm	1863	portrait	French	1851-1900

He painted this altarpiece, one of his largest, for the church of the Catholic order of the Jesuits in Brussels, in the Southern Netherlands. Such commissions were extremely rare in the Dutch Republic. Bloemaert's jubilant colour and festive pageantry befitted the theme and answered the Jesuit's need for a lively backdrop to their main altar	BLOEMAERT, Abraham	Adoration of the Magi	Oil on canvas, 420 x 290 cm	1623-24	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

03387-stillmus.jpg	"Because he was in holy orders, Baschenis is sometimes referred to as Father Evaristo. The Bergamese Baschenis was, more than anything else, the perfect example of a ""specialist"" painter. In fact nearly all his oeuvre was dedicated to painting musical instruments, sometimes his pictures being finished by other painters who added figures (as in the case of two paintings that have recently been found in the Brera in Milan). From this specific point of view, Baschenis is one of the most fascinating and focused painters of the whole of the seventeenth century. His use of realism and light is reminiscent of Caravaggio. His canvases had an intense quality which was dominated by his exceptional technical ability (one thing that stands out is the way in which he depicted dust on the back of stringed instruments).But Baschenis' work never degenerated into a mere display of virtuoso talent. It was rather directed to convey a sense of almost severe moral purpose. Baschenis' success with still-life gave rise, especially in Bergamo itself, to a real fashion for the genre, with other painters following his example."

18777-guard400.jpg	This painting is a view of the Campo San Zanipolo with the loggia temporarily erected outside the Scuola di San Marco for the benediction of Pope Pius VI on 19 May 1782.In May 1782, Pope Pius VI visited the city of Venice. The ceremonies and festivities on that occasion were recorded by Francesco Guardi in a series of four paintings. The city council commissioned Guardi to make four paintings representing the following subjects: the arrival of the pontiff near San Giorgio in Alga, the papal mass in SS Giovanni e Paolo, the papal audience and the blessing of the people on Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo.On the occasion of the Pope Pius VI blessing the crowd a temporary wooden loggia, designed by Antonio Codognato, was erected on the façade of the Scuola di San Marco. Once the Pope had finished his blessing the crowds were allowed to mount the loggia and the existence of at least three variants of this subject, including the present one, attest to the popularity of the composition	GUARDI, Francesco	View of the Campo San Zanipolo in Venice	Oil on canvas, 62 x 47 cm	1782	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

35578-23gevart.jpg	"This is a portrait of Rubens' friend Jan Gaspar Gevaerts (1593-1666). He was a reputable philologist, Neo-Latin poet and historiographer. Characteristically for his intellectual circles he had his name Latinized to Gevartius.After a stay in Holland and Paris Gevartius became the Registrar of the city of Antwerp. In this function he was in charge of official ceremonies in the city and in 1635 helped Rubens with the ""Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi"", one of Rubens most impressive projects.Rubens here intends to represent his friend's humanist attitude: he is sitting at his desk, with a bust of the Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, on whom he wrote an unpublished commentary. The painting is dated around 1628. The composition of the work is not baroque, but fits more easily into the 16th-century tradition of homely portraits of humanists"	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Portrait of Jan Gaspar Gevartius	Oil on panel, 119 x 98 cm	c. 1628	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
08303-pitti.jpg	The picture shows the south wall of the Salone Terreno (Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) on the ground floor of the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule.

13722-marthama.jpg	In composition and overall approach to subject matter Giovanni Andrea appears to have been influenced by Caravaggio's canvas of the same subject. However, while Caravaggio's composition is underpinned by a complex visual and literal tradition associated with this subject, Giovanni Andrea's interpretation appears to be more closely associated with allegorical genre scenes by Venetian masters, such as Titian or Palma Vecchio. Such influence could only have been transmuted into Giovanni Andrea's work through his most influential master, Bernardo Strozzi.

05533-51lemmi.jpg	The only secular frescoes by Botticelli that still exist were discovered 1873, in the Villa Lemmi, at the foot of the Careggi Hill, close to a villa of Cosimo de Medici. They had been concealed under old coats of paint for centuries. Villa Lemmi belonged to the Tornabuoni family, friend of the Medici. It is possible that the frescoes were commissioned on the occasion of a marriage between members of the Tornabuoni and Albizzi families. For a long time the view was held that the couple in question were Giovanna degli Albizzi and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who married in 1486. This assumption has, however, since been proven wrong, for the face of Giovanna that we know from a medallion does not agree with the lady in Botticell's fresco. A possible alternative could be Nanna Tornabuoni and Matteo degli Albizzi, who married in about 1484.It is supposed the frescoes were executed to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi.The frescoes are in a very poor state of preservation, because they were damaged when taken down from the wall. Two of the three fragments found were transferred to canvas and later sold to the Louvre in Paris. The two compositions were originally separated only by a window.One of the fragments probably  represents Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, the other A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts.On this painting there is a strange lack of certainty as to the identity of the group of four young classically dressed women, who are gracefully stepping towards a young woman in front of the splashing spring in order to bring her gifts.

12957-armour.jpg	During his extended stay in Italy from 1621 to 1627, spending the majority of his time in Genoa, Van Dyck made his mark as a portraitist, and numbered many important families from the upper strata of Genoese society among his clients. It has yet to be clarified whether or not the Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf was one of these commissions; various attempts to identify the man in the picture have been inconclusive. It is also possible that the painting is not a portrait but an allegory	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf	Oil on canvas, 90 x 70 cm	1625-27	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

11273-207delac.jpg	Delacroix's grandest pictures have never left their country of origin. Only in Paris can we fully appreciate the bold reconciliation of beauty with cruelty, sensuality with control, fantasy with observation, modernity with tradition that characterises the art of this influential painter.'As Byron signifies Romantic poetry, so Romantic French art means above all Delacroix. Like Byron he achieved his flamboyant artistic effects through intense intellectual application and a firm grasp of technique. Pupil of an academic artist, he was essentially self-taught through the study of the great Renaissance and seventeenth-century colourists in the Louvre. He was fascinated by the vibrant brushwork of the Venetians and their Flemish heir Rubens, imitating their capacity to simulate brilliant daylight even in the shadows, their use of colour instead of line as the primary structural element. It was precisely these effects which, as employed by Constable in the Hay-Wain exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1824, caused a sensation and further exacerbated Delacroix's fashionable Anglomania. In 1825, having sold his picture of the Massacre of Chios to the French State, he set out for London with two English friends, the watercolourists Richard Bonington and Thales Fielding. They visited galleries and the theatre and read English poets. Delacroix met other English artists, including Thomas Lawrence. Appropriately for a painting in an English collection, the lifesize likeness of Louis-Auguste Schwiter, painted after Delacroix's return to Paris, is an essay in the portrait style of Lawrence.Schwiter, a lifelong friend of Delacroix, was himself a painter. He is presented here, however, as a gentleman, dressed in elegant black and hat in hand, standing on what appears to be the terrace of a great country house, as if waiting to be admitted. The blue Chinese vase with its heavily paint-textured flowers contrasts with the red lining of his hat. Like the trumpet vine clippings on the paving, these touches of colour serve to relate the foreground to the brooding sunset landscape (said to have been painted in part by Paul Huet, another artist friend), thus counteracting the isolation of Schwiter's monochrome silhouette.The portrait is lit from the right, a reversal of the more usual illumination from the left, highlighting the left side of the sitter's face and perhaps helping to account for the curiously tentative impression he gives, despite his firm stance in the centre of the picture and his direct gaze. The unemphatic 'modern' pose, with its hint of English-style reserve, and the free 'unfinished' brushwork made this full-length portrait, at once so formal and so unconventional, unacceptable to the judges of the 1827 Paris Salon exhibition, and it was rejected. Delacroix later reworked the painting, finally completing it in 1830	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	Louis-Auguste Schwiter	Oil on canvas, 218 x 144 cm	1826-27	portrait	French	1801-1850
36111-hercules.jpg	With such paintings as painted tapestry, painting within a painting it became possible to use the flat surface of a ceiling vault for narrative depictions.

42748-buff1.jpg	"Blindman's buff is a children's game played as early as 2,000 years ago in Greece. To play the standard game of blindman's buff, one player is blindfolded and then disoriented by being spun around several times. The other players, who are not blindfolded, amuse themselves by calling out to the ""blind man"" and dodging away from him. In the Middle Ages blindman's buff was an adult game, and the blindfolded player was usually struck and buffeted as well, hence ""buff.""

34842-traveler.jpg	It is said that this Dutch painter in Amsterdam was the friend of Rembrandt. His rocky mountainous landscapes show affinities with Rembrandt as well as traces of the work of his mother's uncle, the Mannerist Roelandt Savery. In 1646-47, when Roghman was nineteen- or twenty-years-old he drew a set of more than 240 large views of Dutch castles, presumably to fulfill a commission. This remarkable set of careful topographical drawings, now widely scattered, has nothing in common with Rembrandt's style. Later, in the 1660s, he was influenced by the topographical scenes produced by Allaert van Everdingen during his trips to Scandinavia	ROGHMAN, Roelandt	Valley with Travellers	Oil on canvas	1660s	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700
13024-stuarts.jpg	Early in 1639 the two Stuart brothers, cousins of King Charles I and younger sons of the third Duke of Lennox, set off on a three-year tour of the Continent. They must have posed for Van Dyck just before their departure. Since his arrival at the court, the artist had developed a new portrait type: the double portrait recording friendship, often, but not necessarily, between relatives. The two brothers are shown as if poised on the point of departure, waiting perhaps for servants to bring up their carriage. Both were to die a few years later in the Civil War, and hindsight gives the image an added valedictory poignancy.Van Dyck's compositional skill is surpassed only by his matchless ability to depict satin, lace and meltingly-soft kid leather. But these carefully described effects are somehow not local: the whole surface of the canvas is brought alive with a flickering touch. The costumes, so fashionably similar, are beautifully contrasted - receding warm gold and brown on Lord John, cooler and advancing silver and blue on Lord Bernard - so that the two brothers, complementing each other in apparel, seem to form one shimmering, indivisible whole	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Lord John and Lord Bernard Stuart	Oil on canvas, 238 x 146 cm	c. 1638	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
07499-271y_ram.jpg	This painting exists in two versions, both of which are probably by Caravaggio (who frequently copied his own paintings). Both versions are in Rome, the other in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.The image is a masterpiece of virtuosity whose appeal lies in its soft, caressing light and velvety rendering of cloth, flesh, and plants. The figure is identifiable as St John only virtue of the symbols of Christ displayed in the painting: the ram (sacrificial victim), and the grape-leaves (from whose red juice, akin to the blood of Christ, springs life); otherwise the iconographical subject (the simple, immediately apparent image) appears as a nude youth with an ironic, if not allusive, expression. Its cultivated content and its destination for an aristocratic patron are underscored by the artist's explicit use of a great figurative source of the past: Michelangelo's Ignudi from the Sistine Ceiling. But whereas Michelangelo created abstract and ideal figures with cold lights and a merely theoretical plasticism, Caravaggio models his figure on the careful observation of nature, achieving an image of perfect realism	CARAVAGGIO	St John the Baptist (Youth with Ram)	Oil on canvas, 129 x 94 cm	1602	religious	Italian	1551-1600
13770-hero_lea.jpg	According to legend, Leander, a youth of Abydos, a town on the Asian shore of the Hellespont, used to swim across the waters at night to Sestos on the opposite side to meet his lover Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite. She would guide him by holding up a lighted torch. One stormy night Leander was drowned. Hero in her despair threw herself into the sea. The story is related in this form by the Greek poet Museus (4th-5th cent. A.D.). Ovid tells of the lovers, omitting their death. The theme is found in Italian and Netherlandish painting, especially of the 17th century: the drowned Oleander is borne away by Needs as Hero plunges to her death into the sea	FETTI, Domenico	Hero and Leander	Oil on wood, 42 x 96 cm	1622-23	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
18745-guard211.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself	GUARDI, Francesco	The Doge at the Basilica of La Salute	Oil on canvas, 68 x 100 cm	1766-70	landscape	Italian	1751-1800

They are among the finest examples of court portraiture ever painted. This picture represents Infanta Margarita, born on 12 July 1651, daughter of Philip IV and his second wife, Mariana.

The predella paintings are copies, the originals are in the Musée du Louvre and in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Tours.Despite the framing elements that divide them, the three main panels of the San Zeno Altarpiece form an unified picture space. The central section depicts the Madonna holding her Child and surrounded by music-making angels, seated on a marble throne decorated with Roman-inspired reliefs. The naturalistic trompe l'oeil garlands, seemingly affixed to the top of the picture, create a rapport with the garlands held by the putti in the marble relief at the top of the throne.

The man and his wife are illuminated by an unseen light source from the front left. The man is laughing and puts his left arm around the young woman's shoulders, a gesture echoed by her arm as she hands him some berries. He raises a flute glass in his right hand to her health, while she looks straight ahead rather stiffly. Beside the couple a table is laid with a silver pot, some dried fish and a small loaf of bread, but the way it has been truncated at one end gives it the look of a stage prop. The rear of the tavern is in shadow, so that all that may be distinguished is the incidental figure chalking up orders in front of the fireplace, a narrow shelf, and an empty birdcage hanging above. The room opens up to the rear at the right, giving a view of a sunny courtyard in which a market stall has been erected.Although the painting was for many years known simply as The Lovers at Breakfast, the two protagonists, quite different in type, have been identified as the artist and Isabella de Wolff, whom he married in 1658 and who was a niece of the painter Pieter de Grebber.The iconography of the painting distinguishes it as part of a painting tradition well-known to the educated contemporary viewer: the carousing, feasting couple, the ambience of the tavern with the landlady at the blackboard, the highly significant bread and fish still-life on the table. All of these elements point to the subject of the 'prodigal son regaling with the harlots in the inn'. This Biblical parable, much loved and widespread in seventeenth-century Dutch painting, was understood as an admonition against a life of sin and vice. A link between the Biblical story and an artist's self-portrait was not, however, completely unusual. Rembrandt, for instance, had depicted himself in a similar pose some twenty years earlier, in his Self-portrait with Saskia in the Scene from the Prodigal Son, which is also in the Dresden collection	METSU, Gabriel	Portrait of the Artist with His Wife Isabella de Wolff in a Tavern	Oil on oak panel, 36 x 31 cm	1661	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700

23116-10carme5.jpg	This painting formed a panel of the predella of the dismembered altarpiece in the Carmelite church San Niccol&#242; al Carmine in Siena. The five scenes in the predella depict events in the history of the Carmelite Order: The Annunciation to Sobac, Hermits at the Fountain of Elijah, St Albert Presents the Rule to the Carmelites, The Pope Issues a Bull to a Carmelite Delegation, and The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV.The long central predella and the next two scenes represent the modern documented history of the Carmelite Order. Some time between 1206 and 1214, Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem, traveled to Mount Carmel an presented the hermits with a Rule. The Rule was accepted by Pope Honorius III in 1226 with a papal bull. A further papal dispensation allowed for the alteration of the Carmelite habit, exchanging the black and white horizontally striped outer cape for a simple white one	LORENZETTI, Pietro	Predella panel: The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV	Tempera on wood	1328-29	religious	Italian	1301-1350

10147-42religi.jpg	Signed at bottom left with a winged serpent, the artist's sign.The works of Lucas Cranach the Elder are as varied and full of incident as was his career as an artist. As a young man, he lived and worked in Vienna from 1500 to 1503, the period when he came in contact with the Danube School, whose development was much influenced by his own work. After 1505 he worked as court painter to Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony in Wittenberg, and in this citadel of the German Reformation he established and directed a large and busy workshop. In addition to altarpieces and religious pictures he painted mythological subjects, genre scenes and portraits, as well as executed a considerable body of graphic work.The black wall on the left side of this painting is the result of a later repainting, presumably a curtain was there originally.

05197-09folly.jpg	"In the midst of a luxuriant summer landscape, a surgeon removes an object from the head of a man tied to a chair; a monk and a nun look on. This little picture may not be entirely by Bosch; the awkward and inexpressive figures are perhaps by an inferior hand, but only Bosch could have been responsible for the landscape background whose delicately painted forms recall the vista in his early Epiphany. The open-air operation, its circular shape suggesting a mirror, is set within a framework of elaborate calligraphical decoration containing the inscription: ""Master, cut the stone out, my name is Lubbert Das.""In Bosch's day, the stone operation was a piece of quackery in which the patient was supposedly cured of his stupidity through the removal of the stone of folly from his forehead. Fortunately, it was performed only in fiction, not in fact, for in literary examples of this theme it generally left the patient worse off than before. The name ""Lubbert"", on the other hand, frequently appears in Dutch literature to designate persons exhibiting an unusually high degree of human stupidity. The stone operation was occasionally represented by later Netherlandish artists, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This subject undoubtedly inspired Bosch's picture, but no extant version of it accounts for the funnel and the book perched on the heads of two of the characters, nor does it explain the presence of the monk and the nun, although their apparent acquiescence in the quackery certainly places them in an unfavourable light. It will be noted, too, that what the surgeon extracts from Lubbert's head is not a stone, but a flower; another flower of the same species lies on the table at the right. The flowers has identified as tulips and their presence is explained as a play on the Dutch word for tulip which in the sixteenth century also carried the connotation of stupidity and folly."

Beginning in c. 1450, he built a castle for his mistress, Bianca Pellegrini, and named it after her, Roccabianca. Here was a room that was completely painted between 1458 and 1464. The subject of the cycle was the famous Griselda from one of the novellas in Boccaccio's Decameron, a story frequently illustrated in fifteenth-century painting, especially on wedding chests (cassoni). The paintings in the Stanza di Griselda (now in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan) comprise twenty-four monochrome picture compartments divided into two registers. There is also an astrological program on the vaulted ceiling.The paintings were executed by an unknown painter working in the manner of Niccol&#242; da Varallo (1420-1489)	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Picture cycle from the Stanza di Griselda	Fresco	1458-64	mythological	Italian	1451-1500

39592-2pesaro0.jpg	Titian was neither such a universal scholar as Leonardo, nor such an outstanding personality as Michelangelo, nor such a versatile and attractive man as Raphael. He was principally a painter, but a painter whose handling of paint equalled Michelangelo's mastery of draughtsmanship. This supreme skill enabled him to disregard all the time-honoured rules of composition, and to rely on colour to restore the unity which he apparently broke up.We need but look at Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family which was begun only some fifteen years after Giovanni Bellini's Madonna with saints to realize the effect which his art must have had on contemporaries. It was almost unheard of to move the Holy Virgin out of the centre of the picture, and to place the two administering saints - St Francis, who is recognizable by the Stigmata (the wounds of the Cross), and St Peter, who has deposited the key (emblem of his dignity) on the steps of the Virgin's throne - not symmetrically on each side, as Giovanni Bellini had done, but as active participants of a scene.In this altar-painting, Titian had to revive the tradition of donors' portraits, but did it in an entirely novel way. The picture was intended as a token of thanksgiving for a victory over the Turks by the Venetian nobleman Jacopo Pesaro, and Titian portrayed him kneeling before the Virgin while an armoured standard-bearer drags a Turkish prisoner behind him. St Peter and the Virgin look down on him benignly while St Francis, on the other side, draws the attention of the Christ Child to the other members of the Pesaro family, who are kneeling in the corner of the picture. The whole scene seems to take place in an open courtyard, with two giant columns which rise into the clouds where two little angels are playfully engaged in raising the Cross.Titian's contemporaries may well have been amazed at the audacity with which he had dared to upset the old-established rules of composition. They must have expected, at first, to find such a picture lopsided and unbalanced. Actually it is the opposite. The unexpected composition only serves to make it gay and lively without upsetting the harmony of it all. The main reason is the way in which Titian contrived to let light, air and colours unify the scene. The idea of making a mere flag counterbalance the figure of the Holy Virgin would probably have shocked an earlier generation, but this flag, in its rich, warm colour, is such a stupendous piece of painting that the venture was a complete success.

Behind Him are placed four figures in front of a flat and undefined background of a striking red, which is decorated with a printed black design of curving tendrils. The artist's technical skill is evident in the transparency of the haloes, which are subtly painted as if they were fine lace. Notable are the modelling of the hands and faces, and the lyrical poses of the Virgin and Child and the background figures	FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI	Virgin and Child with St Catherine and Angels	Mixed technique on panel, 62 x 42 cm	c. 1490	religious	Italian	1451-1500
33958-sebasti1.jpg	During his career Reni and his workshop produced two types of images of St Sebastian, which exist in various versions. The first type, from around 1615, exists in the autograph work now in the Musei di Strada Nuova, Palazzo Rosso in Genoa. Reni returned to the subject around 1616-17, with a different, larger composition. Many versions exist of this work, the painting in the Dulwich Gallery, London, is most likely the original and first one.Powerfully Caravaggesque in its dramatic chiaroscuro, Reni's Sebastian is shown as a striking nude, indebted in its form to antique sculpture and to the classicism of the Bolognese school of the Carracc	RENI, Guido	St Sebastian	Oil on canvas, 170 x 130 cm	1617-18	religious	Italian	1601-1650

37527-2farnes2.jpg	Chigi's bedchamber was adjacent to the banquet hall, and he had Sodoma decorate two of its wall, probably in conjunction with the decoration of the hall. The surfaces of the walls open up onto a narrative with large-scale figures, as if inviting visitors to enter. In the painting on the wall to the right, the women of Darius's family approach the Macedonian ruler. Sisigambis, the mother of the defeated Persian ruler, initially mistook Hephaistion for Alexander, but the true ruler inclines graciously toward her. The painter revels in his depiction of female grace, pushing the female bodies close together before Alexander and the viewer. The forms on the left also repeat the triad of goddesses, Venus, Ceres, and Juno from Raphael's spandrel in the Loggia di Psiche. The smithy scene along the base of the wall alludes to the love themes and to the fireplace	SODOMA, Il	The Women of Darius's Family before Alexander the Great	Fresco	c. 1517	historical	Italian	1501-1550
39821-17strada.jpg	In the final period, which saw Titian focussing his attention on religious themes, he still found the energy to paint portraits. Between 1567 and 1568 he produced two of his greatest masterpieces in this field: the Prado Self-Portrait and the Portrait of Jacopo Strada in Vienna.The portrait of the well-known antiquarian Jacopo Strada, one of the most famous of Titian's late portraits, represents Jacopo Strada, an expert of antiquities as presenting a small Venus statue. On the table there are some objects, among them a letter addressed to Titian. The decorative frame with the inscription is a later addition from the workshop of Titian.The painting is of the very highest quality. It is painted in energetic dabs of brown and ochre yellow, offset by the black velvet jerkin with a silver fox fur flung around the shoulders. The careful depiction of the details which allude to the profession of the sitter (the statuette, the coins, the cartouche and the books) do not distract from the characterization of Strada, who is looking enquiringly at someone outside the painting	TIZIANO Vecellio	Portrait of Jacopo Strada	Oil on canvas, 125 x 95 cm	1567-68	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

31453-3saints1.jpg	The decorative skills of Pinturichio are apparent in the vault of this room he painted in the papal apartments of the Vatican. He accentuated the ribs of the vault and in doing so created strong framing elements within which he placed the scenes of the vault. Pinturichio filled all of the available surface with imagery, reserving the direct centre of the ceiling for the Borgia coat of arms. A later pope, Julius II, found serious objection to the decoration, and refused to live in the apartments.The frescoes depict the myth of Isis and Osiris	PINTURICCHIO	Vault decoration	Fresco	1493-95	other	Italian	1451-1500
39585-1assunt1.jpg	"Titian worked on this huge altarpiece for more than two years from 1516 to 1518. It has to be seen as a milestone in Titian's career establishing him as a more universal artist who drew inspiration from outside the confines of Venice. Indeed the powerful figures of the Apostles reflect the influence of Michelangelo, whereas the painting demonstrates clear iconographical similarities with the works of Raphael. Above all, what emerges most strongly in the assumption is Titian's desire to break definitely with the traditions of Venetian painting in order to arrive at a synthesis of dramatic force and dynamic tension which will become from this moment on the most obvious characteristic of his work.The picture is composed of three orders. At the bottom are the Apostles (humanity), amazed and stunned by the wondreous happening. St Peter is kneeling with his hand on his breast, St Thomas is pointing at the Virgin, and St Andrew in a red cloak is stretching forward. In the middle, the madonna, slight and bathed in light, is surrounded by by a host of angels that accompany her joyfully hailing. Above is the Eternal Father, serene and noble majesty, calling the Virgin to him with a look of love.The painting is signed as ""Ticianus"" low down in the middle of the picture"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on wood, 690 x 360 cm	1516-18	religious	Italian	1501-1550

43540-anselmus.jpg	Family harmony is a source of prosperity and happiness. So proclaims the Latin inscription in the cartouche at the top of the picture. This is the message of this family portrait, which does much more than simply depict wealthy members of Antwerp high society. Antonius Anselmus, an alderman of the city from 1580 to 1582, and his wife Joanna Hooftmans, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, are placed in front of a neutral background, accompanied by their two children, both born in Antwerp, Gillis in 1575 and Joanna in 1576. A third child was to be born in Hamburg, where the family sought refuge for a time after the city of Antwerp was returned to the Catholics. The Anselmus family, like the Hooftmans, were Calvinists.The family's high social ranking is immediately visible in the various items of decor: the carved furniture, the silver inkwell on the table, and the fragile Venetian glass vase, as well as the costly lace on the parents' garments and the children's aprons. The little girl holds a sumptuous vermeil rattle, a prestigious object symbolising the wealth of the newly born child. This object was offered to very young children by a godfather or an important person. The one represented here has at one end a whistle and at the other a wolf's tooth, to which popular belief attributed the double power of protecting children against the evil eye and reducing teething pain. On the table between the couple are the marriage gloves and a rose, symbols of the love that unites them. The children express the prosperity of the couple as does the fruit being held by the elder. At the same time the tame bird on his shoulder is a metaphor for a successful education.Maerten de Vos, who excelled in the portrait genre, was also known for his religious paintings, producing, among other works, six paintings of episodes from the life of St Paul for the dining room of Gillis Hooftmans, Joanna's father. It is possibly following this commission that he painted the family portrait. By creating a unified and enveloping space around the figures, the artist succeeded in given a new dimension to the genre, intensifying both the psychological study and the allegorical significance.

24069-3sposi01.jpg	The tent-like vaulting of the Camera degli Sposi contains: in the centre the trompe-l'oeil oculus; in the diamond-shaped compartments eight busts of emperors in medallions; in the side vaults scenes from the myths of Orpheus, Arion, and Hercules.Although painted first, the painting of the ceiling, done in grisaille and imitation gold mosaics, is meant to be the logical continuation of the vertical arrangements of the space. It represents a tent-like roof with pointed vaults above the walls; the painting makes it appear higher than it actually is. Broad groins ornamented with meanders rise up from the painted basket capitals, dividing the ceiling into eight lozenge-shaped fields drawn to sharp points at the bottom, like spandrels. Each lozenge contains a round medallion in which depicted are the first eight Roman emperors. The twelve triangular vaults above the lunettes contain scenes from classical myth and legend, all backed by gold mosaics. First comes three scenes from the Orpheus myth, then three relating to Arion, and finally six depictions of some of the labours of Hercules	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Ceiling decoration	Walnut oil on plaster and fresco	1465-74	religious	Italian	1451-1500

09052-sunshine.jpg	As a result of their approach to Impressionism, Belgian artists occasionally juxtaposed native Flemish styles with imported Impressionist styles derived from the French.

The monumental figures (Judith, David, Samson, Jael) have an imposing physicality, emphasized by their bright colours and strong contrasts	POZZO, Andrea	Painting on the pendentive: Samson	Fresco	1685	religious	Italian	1651-1700
